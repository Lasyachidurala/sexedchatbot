Can I use Viagra?", "A lot of guys don't want to admit it, but not being able to get or keep anerectionhappens more often than you'd think. Guys usually have trouble getting or keeping an erection when they're nervous, scared or worried about something. They might be worried about how they'll \"perform,\" or they could be feeling guilty about havingsex. They might be afraid of getting a sexually transmitted disease (STD), or, if they are with a girl, getting their partner pregnant. Drugs (including some anti-depressants) and alcohol can also prevent you from getting and/or maintaining an erection.If you can keep an erection when you're alone, then you're probably worried about something when you're with your partner. Think about how you feel and then talk to your partner about your concerns. You might be putting too much pressure on yourself or not protecting yourself by using condoms andbirth control. Or maybe you'll discover that you're really not ready for sex right now and need to wait until it feels right.Since you're a teen and therefore young to have this happen, you should get checked by your doctor or clinician to see whether anything physical is going on. Remember that our brain is the most powerful sex organ we have\u2014so something asminoras stress can affect your ability to get and keep an erection.And remember, the idea that you canejaculateand get another erection right away is a myth for most guys. Usually, you have to wait a while. The time between ejaculating and being able to get another erection is called the refractory period. It can last minutes or hours depending on a guy's age and health.Viagra is a medication that is prescribed to people with certain medical conditions. You should never take medication if it hasn't been prescribed to you, no matter what it is. Viagra should not be used recreationally. Some teenage andadultmales who have abused Viagra have ended up in the emergency room. It's just not worth it."], ["I just found out that I have a sexually transmitted disease (STD). Does this mean I should never have sex again? What do I tell my partner?", "No, it does not mean you should never havesexagain. It does mean, however, that you should talk to any partners before engaging in sexual behaviors (oral, anal andvaginal sex), about your status.If you end up\u00a0testing\u00a0positive for anSTD, know that you are not alone. It can be helpful to get more information about it so you can know the facts before you talk to anyone else about it. Yourhealth care provider, a family planning counselor or the person that tested you can often be a good person to talk to about any questions you have. Sometimes people need time to get used to the news themselves before they feel comfortable talking about it with another person.Some people get really nervous thinking about talking to a partner about an STD diagnosis. They might be afraid that their partner will be upset, dump them, say mean things to them or even go around telling other people. Even if you're nervous, it's really important to talk with your partner or partners about your diagnosis. If you have an STD, there is a chance that they have it, too. It's important for your partner to get tested, too. If only one person in a partnership is treated, you can get re-infected right away.Regardless of the kind of STD you have, practicingsafer sexcan help minimize the risk of transmitting it to a partner or getting re-infected.\u00a0Talking with a partner about an STD diagnosis is something that is usually best done in a non-sexual situation. In other words, don't wait to mention it until you're in a sexual situation. You can let your partner know that you got tested and what the results are. It might help to have some information about the STD to share with your partner, including how to reduce the risk of transmission. Having all of the facts about the STD (how you get it, treatment, etc.) will make this conversation a lot easier.Safety is important. You're the expert on your own situation so you probably have an idea of whether it is safe to share this information with your partner. If you feel that you would be physically unsafe if you share your STD status with a partner, you may be able to get support doing so. Talk with your health care provider about whether they might be able to help inform partners that you tested positive for an STD. If you feel unsafe in your relationship, you can also get support from theNational Teen Dating Abuse Hotlineat1-866-331-9474or online atLoveisrespect."], ["I'm a teen and I'm pregnant.

Sooner or later, a situation arises when we wonder what to do with our feelings.In this case, it is helpful to think about whether or not it is a good idea to want to date your best friend, regardless ofgender.

The images we see on television and in magazines and movies send messages about what's beautiful and what makes someone successful. People often try to imitate those images, changing their clothes, haircut or style to be more like what they see in the media.The problem is, what's shown in the media doesn't usually represent reality. The media likes to show people who have rare body types\u2014people who are very skinny or very muscular, for example. But these kinds of body types are actually pretty unusual. Still, these images can make many teens feel like their body type is not good enough.When we don't look like these images, we may feel inferior or less successful. Our best defense is knowing that the media uses tricks, such as airbrushing or digital enhancement, to make people look \"better\" than they really do.

I've heard there's even a pill where you only get your period once a year. Is it OK to not get my period?", "Seasonale, Seasonique and LoSeasonique are the brand names ofFDA-approvedbirth control pillsthat allow a woman or girl to only have four menstrual periods per year.Lybrelis the brand name of FDA-approvedbirth controlpills that allow a woman or girl to only get her period once a year. Seasonal, Seasonique, Jolessa, Introvate and Lybrel are different from otherbirthcontrol pills because women or girls who take them don't experience monthly periods or any of the common complaints associated withmenstruation, like cramping and mood swings.How does it work?Like other forms of hormonal birth control, these birth control pills release hormones into a person's body that cause her not to ovulate. Since she is not releasing an egg (ovum), she cannot become pregnant. The hormones also cause her cervical mucus to thicken, which helps preventspermfrom reaching heruterus,cervixand fallopian tubes.With most birth control pills, there is a week of placebo pills at the end of each pack. Placebo pills contain nohormonesand are included in the pack only to help her stay on schedule with taking a pill every day. With Seasonique, Seasonale and Lybrel, girls continue to take an \"active\" pill\u2014one that contains hormones\u2014each and every day so that the lining of the uterus never gets built-up or sheds. Thus, they do not get their periods.When taken correctly, all hormonal birth control has a failure rate of approximately one-percent per year. Taking any birth control pill consistent and correctly is the best way to ensure protection from an unintendedpregnancy.What are the drawbacks?Some women and girls like getting their periods for a variety of reasons. Many use their period as confirmation that they aren't pregnant. Others just feel like it's an important part of being female. With pills like Seasonique, Seasonale or Lybrel, girls need to take apregnancy testif they are experiencing common symptoms of pregnancy, like breast soreness or tenderness, having to urinate (pee) more often, feeling really tired, feeling nauseous and throwing up.Like with all hormonal birth control options, there are some side effects. The most common are unscheduled bleeding, headaches, nausea, vomiting, breast tenderness and difficulty wearing contact lenses due to dry eyes. These side effects, especially nausea and vomiting, may subside within the first three months of use.The serious side effects of these pills don't happen often, especially if you are in good health and do not smoke. Below are some examples of serious side effects:blood clotsliver tumorshigh blood pressureAnd, of course, hormonal birth control pills don't provide any protection against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), so it is still important to use condoms even when on birth control pills.How do I get these pills?All hormonal birth control requires a prescription from ahealth care provider.

Your next best bet is to practicesafer sex, such as using either a male orfemale condomand/ordental damevery time and getting tested regularly for STDs and asking your partners to do the same.STDs cannot spontaneously occur. There is risk only when one person already has an STD in their body. Since most STDs don't have symptoms, you can't always rely on what you see to tell you whether or not an infection is present since most STD infections do not have any symptoms, so it is better to be safe.While different STDs are spread in different ways, most are spread either through skin-to-skin genital contact or getting sexual fluids (and sometimes blood) in the mouth,urethraof thepenis,anusorvagina. This means that touching above the waist with clothes on is safe. But most other kinds of close sexual contact with an infected partner carries some risk\u2014sometimes extremely low, sometimes very high\u2014of getting an STD.So, if you decide to be sexual with a partner, here are some things you can do to reduce your chances of getting an STD.Practice safer sex with each partner each time. Fenway Community Health has a greatbrochurethat can teach you how to be a safer sex expert!Get testedregularly, and always get tested BEFORE you have sex with a new partner. Your partner should also be tested.Know your partner well before having sex. Ask your partner if he or she has ever had an STD and if it was treated. Ask when your partner last got tested and if they are willing to get tested again. Ask if he or she practiced safer sex with past partners and if that included oral sex. Know that people sometimes don't know they have an infection or may not consider certain behaviors risky, when in fact they are.Learn about STDs, how they are transmitted, and which activities are low risk and which are high risk so that you can make informed decisions about how to protect your sexual health. For example, kissing and massage are low risk. Unprotected vaginal or anal sex is high risk.Choose your sexual partners carefully. Take relationships slowly so you have the chance to get to know what your partner is about, what his or her sexual history is like and how your partner treats you in general. This will help you develop a relationship that is healthy and includes open, honest communication about these important issues.Even if you've both been tested and nothing has shown up, you should still practice safer sex every single time you have sex to guarantee that you both remain safe and protected.You should also use condoms if you have oral sex involving a penis. Flavored condoms are made specifically for oral sex and are available in most drugstores. During oral sex that involves avulvaor anus, use a dental dam, such as a Sheer Glyde Dam, to cover the vulva or anus. Acondomcut open and placed over a vulva is also an effective barrier, and some people use plastic wrap\u2014the kind used for food storage\u2014for oral sex on a vulva, which is better than not using any protection. Still, a Sheer Glyde Dental Dam offers the best protection during oral sex on a female because it is less likely to break if stretched thin the way plastic wrap can.What is important to remember is that although latex, polyurethane, polyisoprene or nitrile condoms are highly effective products, sometimes people don't use them correctly.

But this is a pretty limited definition, and it doesn't include people who havesexwith someone of the same sex; it also doesn't include other sexual behaviors.Some people think that if you have oral or anal sex, then you've lost your virginity. Still others believe that a \"true\" loss of virginity only happens when at least one person has anorgasm.So, guess what? Defining \"virginity\" and giving it one label isn't as important as other things, like making sure you feel good about any sexual activity you decide to do and making sure you're protected from sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) or unplannedpregnancy.The important thing is to stay true to yourself. That means taking your time to make decisions about sex that are best for you\u2014not anyone else. Base these decisions on your own beliefs,valuesand feelings. If there are sexual things you don't want to do until you're older, or when you're in a certain kind of relationship, or when you're partnered with someone for life, those can help you determine how you define virginity.Secondary VirginitySometimes after a person has sex, whether it's vaginal, oral or anal, they decide that it was a bad decision and they don't want to do it again. Some people refer to this decision not to have sex again as having \"secondary virginity.\" In other cases, a person\u2014guy or girl\u2014might have been raped or abused. Since they didn'tconsentto that behavior, it doesn't really count, and they consider themselves virgins until they make the choice to have sex with someone.This works for a lot of people.

To ensure that the results are accurate, it is important to follow the instructions on theboxexactly. It is most effective to wait until after a girl has missed her period to take a pregnancy test. If she is more than a day or two late for her period, she can take a home pregnancy test. Some newer home pregnancy tests, however, say they can give an accurate result the day a period is due or even a day or two before.Home pregnancy tests typically cost between $8 and $20 at a drugstore or grocery store. Some are available for even less than that online, but require a credit card number in order to purchase them.Health CenterWhile home pregnancy tests are very accurate, girls might also want to considergoing to a clinicfor a pregnancy test, or at least for a second test. This can verify the home results and provide her with more options for care, including tests for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs),birth controloptions and general answers to her questions aboutbirthcontrol and safersex.A pregnancy test at afamily planning clinicmight cost anywhere between $5 and $20, and it may or may not include the cost of the appointment itself.

Teens don't have to go to a clinic or health care provider alone if a parent or guardian knows and is willing to help. Parents/guardians can offer guidance and support during a really stressful time.

Girls should also get in the habit of performing their ownbreast self-exameach month (a week after each period is a good time), just to get familiar with their own breasts so that they will notice if something changes or feels different.When a breast exam is performed by yourhealth care provider, you will go into an examination room, undress and put on a paper or cloth gown. A health care provider will come into the room for the exam. If you would prefer a clinician of a particularsex, you can request that ahead of time.Your health care provider will listen to your heart and lungs and may ask you to lie on your back for a breast exam. Some health care providers will teach you how to examine your own breasts and feel for any unusual lumps or swellings that might need medical care. Because it is common for girls' breasts to be lumpy during their teen years and into their early 20s, some gynecologists choose not to do a breast exam and say it's not necessary for younger teens to do breast self-exams.

It has two main parts: theshaftand theglans(or thehead). The inside of the shaft of the penis is made up of spongy tissue. When that tissue fills with blood, the penis becomes hard. This is called anerection. The head has a lot of nerve endings, which is why touching the penis can feel good.Inside the penis is a tube called theurethra.Urine(or pee) passes through this as well assemen. Semen comes out of the urethra when a guy ejaculates. Semen containssperm, or reproductive cells, that can make a girl pregnant.Luckily, when a guy has an erection, there is a ring of muscle inside the body that closes off the bladder and makes it impossible for urine tocome out.Penises come in all shapes and sizes. But the average length of an erect,adultpenis is between five and seven inches. Because teen boys' bodies are growing throughpuberty, there is no accurate average size for younger guys. Most guys reach their full adult penis size by the time they get into their early 20s.A lot of guys get hung up on the size of their penis. But the truth is that size doesn't matter that much when it comes to being able to give or receive sexual pleasure. Pleasing a partner is not about the size and shape of body parts, but being with the right person for you.Some penises curve and some arestraight. A curved penis may just mean that there's more spongy tissue on one side of the shaft than the other. That causes the penis to bend when it fills with blood and becomes erect.Only if the penis is bent in the shape of an L should it cause any pain or problem with sexual functioning. If you have pain when you have an erection or the curve gets worse, have a doctor check it out."], ["I'm pregnant and not sure what I want to do yet. What should I consider about teen parenting before I make a decision?", "There are many, many pros and cons to think about. Here's our list of things to take into consideration.Possible ProsParenting\u2014including loving a child and being loved in return, watching that child grow and develop\u2014can be one of the most joyful experiences in life.Most people, both teens and adults, find that becoming a parent pushes them to a new level of responsibility. A parent realizes that a child is completely dependent, so that parent may get and keep a job to support the child. Some teens or adults may really enjoy this responsibility. It can be rewarding, though difficult, work.Possible ConsTeen parents cannot live the life of a typical teenager. You will not be able to go out with friends as often. You will have to figure out how to finish school while caring for a baby who needs care 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Your life will revolve around another person who depends on you.Teen parents need money because raising a child is expensive. Many teen parents are still in high school, so they don't necessarily have the skills or experience to get a job that supports them as well as a baby. If they drop out of high school to work and therefore don't have a high school diploma, teen parents may only qualify for lower-paying jobs. Those teen parents who go on to higher-paying careers may have to depend on the support of parents or others in their lives while they continue with high school, skill training or college.Babies also change relationships between couples. Parenting can put a lot of stress\u2014financial and other day-to-day stress\u2014on even the most solid relationships. If the couple splits up, there can be bad feelings and conflict that may interfere with the support needed to raise a child. Despite this, children can benefit from the positive involvement of both parents. Being a parent may mean working hard to maintain good communication with someone you are no longer involved with.Financial CostsThe average yearly cost of having a child under the age of two is between $9,500 (for a child raised in a single parent household) and $14,500 (for a child raised in a two-parent household), according to theExpenditures on Children by Families 2008report. Annual costs for raising a child increase each year of the child's life. This cost depends on a lot of factors.Rent is typically the most expensive part of a household budget. So, you need to figure out where you'll live and how much that will cost. Staying with your parent(s) or other relatives, either rent-free or with a low rent, may be an option you can consider.Other major expenses are food, clothes, health care, day care, transportation and any future training you might need for a job (technical school, GED classes, college, etc.).Check out websites that offer \"baby calculators\"to get a personalized look at how much you would probably spend.Another way to understand these costs is to do some basic research in your area. When you have collected the prices below, use them to create a realistic budget.Spend some time in the grocery store checking out prices, including baby food. How much would three meals a day cost? For a month?Look in the newspaper at the cost of one- or two-bedroom apartments and utilities.Price at least one full outfit for a child.Try to estimate childcare costs. Who will watch your child while you're in school or working? Do you have a relative who can help for free or at a low cost? Or call a local day care facility and ask for yearly or monthly prices.Try to estimate the cost of transportation. If you have a car, how much are your payments, insurance, gas, maintenance and repairs? If you use public transportation, what impact will having a baby have on the number of times you travel? How much will this cost each month?Get a sense of how much health care will cost for you. Do you have health insurance? How much is a visit to the doctor or clinic?Try to estimate costs for health care for a child. How much is it to add a child to your insurance policy? If you don't have insurance, look into getting a policy just for your child. How much is one visit to the doctor or clinic? What about a trip to the emergency room?If you can't earn enough money to pay the bills, there are programs that can help, at least a little. You may be eligible for public assistance, which could potentially help with income, health insurance or food. You can also get help with food through the governmentWIC program. Most states now help single mothers pay for childcare while they attend school or work. If you need to, you should look at using these programs while you establish yourself. The long-term goal is to take care of yourself and your child. These programs can help get you there.Under the law, all legal fathers must pay child support. However, if you are not married to your baby's father, he may not be considered the legal father; the process for establishing paternity\u2014proving that he is the legal father\u2014varies from state to state."], ["What is circumcision and does it affect sexual performance?", "Males are born with something called aforeskin, which is a sheath of skin that covers theheadof thepenis.

Is it safe?", "Cyber and phonesexusually involve sex talk on the phone or texting on the phone or messaging over the Internet. Sometimes, one or both people masturbate as they talk about sexually arousing things.For some people, cyber andphone sexare ways to have sexual experiences with another person without the risks ofpregnancyand sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).Couples who are separated by distance sometimes use phone or cybersex to stay close while they're apart. Other times, people in committed relationships use phone or cybersex to have sexual activity outside of their relationship that they don't see as cheating. Some people do consider this kind of sex cheating. It's up to each couple to decide what is OK and what's not OK in their relationship.Cyber and phone sex have no risk of pregnancy orSTD, since you aren't in physical contact with the other person. They can carry emotional risks and privacy risks, though.If you exchange phone numbers, screen names or addresses with people you don't know or only know over the Internet, it can be dangerous since you don't know who you're talking to. That's especially true with cybersex when people can lie easily about their age, sex and who they are. Sexual predators (usually adults) sometimes disguise themselves and go online to lure young people into sexual encounters,pornography,prostitutionand other illegal and dangerous activities.That's why it's important to never arrange a personal meeting with someone you only know through the Internet. People have been hurt and even killed by agreeing to meet with people they only know online.

Who can help me make the decision about whether or not to choose adoption for my child?", "There are many pros and cons to think about. Here's our list of things to take into consideration.Possible ProsAdoption is an option for people who feel unready or unable to raise a child at this time but can't get anabortionor don't want to have one.Somebirthparents that choose adoption do so because they feel adoption provides their child with a loving, stable home and parent(s) or guardian(s) who have the financial resources to support a child.There is also the possibility of kinship adoption where a family member, like a sibling, parent or grandparent, actually adopts and raises the child. That way, the child remains in the extended family, so there's an increased chance that you can have a lot of contact and a relationship with your child.Possible ConsChoosing adoption means being pregnant for nine months and then giving custody of the child to someone else. This can be very traumatic.In the case of a closed adoption\u2014when the birth mother's contact information is kept private\u2014some adopted children wish to meet their birth parents, and vice versa. Some find each other after long searches and develop meaningful relationships; others find the person and, for a variety of reasons, never establish a relationship. Still others never find their parent or child. For some parents or children, that can be upsetting or challenging to imagine or deal with.You are the person who has to live with your decision to place your child for adoption, become a teen parent or get an abortion. It's important to make sure you get the support you need to make this important decision in a way that's right for you.It can help to talk to a trustedadult, parent or guardian during this process. A counselor or therapist can help you to sort out your feelings and to help you make the best decision for you.You can find a counselor in several ways:Afamily planning clinic, such asPlanned Parenthoodat1-800-230-PLAN (7526)Health Department centers or social servicesMental health center or family service agency (search online for \"social services,\" \"family social services\" or \"family counseling services\" in your area or zip code)A counselor's job is to help you sort out your feelings, so you can make a decision that feels right for you. Even if the counselor has strong feelings about adoption, abortion or teen parenting, they should not try to influence your decision. If you ever feel like your counselor is biased or is not providing you with a balanced environment to sort out your feelings, try to find another person to help you.

If the two overlap, pregnancy is possible. It's really hard to figure out when those days are. This is because the three days the egg is viable can happen at different times each month.Remember that pregnancy isn't the only thing to consider.

I'm upset and scared. I'm not sure how to react. Could I have an STD? Should I get tested?", "It's really great that your partner was so open and honest about his or her STD testing results. A lot of times it's really hard to talk to a partner about your STD status, so the fact that your partner communicated with you is really great. It says that your partner wants to make sure you get tested and treated, if necessary. It also says that he or she cares about your sexual health and that your partner feels like he or she can communicate with you. These are all good things.It's normal to feel taken a back or a bit shocked at first. However, once you let that pass there are a few things you'll need to do.First, talk to your current partner.Thank your partner for telling you and then ask when he or she got tested and what STD he or she tested positive for. If you and your partner have engaged in sexual behaviors, you'll need to be tested for STDs to know if you have the same STD. It's helpful to tell a health care provider which STD you think you might be at risk for.Second, you'll want to get tested for STDs also, even if you were recently tested.You can get tested by your health care provider, or get tested at a local free or low-cost and confidential clinic.Find a clinic near you. They can also help you get treatment if you test positive for an STD. \u00a0It is important to follow instructions from a health care provider, including taking any medications exactly as directed. This will help ensure a full cure for a bacterial STD (such as chlamydia, gonorrhea or syphilis) and will also help with symptoms and reduce the risk of passing a viral STD (like herpes or HPV).Lastly, but certainly not least, you'll want to notify any past partners if there is a chance your current partner contracted the STD from you.It's really hard sometimes to tell who gave whom an STD. If you've engaged in sexual behaviors with people other than your current partner, you'll want to reach out and tell them that they may want to be tested for STDs.Remember, over 50 percent of sexually active people will get an STD by age 25. So having to deal with an STD is not unusual.

Penises come in different sizes and different shapes. Your penis will continue to grow until you've finishedpuberty. While there's a lot of talk about penis size, the truth penises come in different shapes and sizes. Some are a lot smaller whenflaccidor limp. Some are longer and some are shorter; some are wide and some are thin. The thing is that everyone's penis is unique. If you looked at pictures of penises, you would find that penises are all very different, and there is no such thing as \"normal\" or the \"right way\" for a penis to look.Some guys will try anything to enlarge their penis. Save your money! Creams, pills and \"penis pumps\" might make your penis a little bigger for a little while, but the change won't last. In fact, penis pumps can actually damage the tissue and nerves in the penis, if used often. So a guy could end up being unable to get anerectionor lose feeling in his penis. Don't believe those pictures you see either. They've been altered to make the penises look like they're really pumped up.A lot of guys grow up learning to measure their masculinity by the size of their penis because they believe penis size is important. For guys who are attracted to women: The truth is that thevaginais elastic. This means that the vagina can accommodate a big or a small penis. In fact, it can tightly accommodate something as small as a finger. Also, most of the nerve endings in the vagina are concentrated at the entrance. So, extra penis length won't necessarily do that much in terms of giving a woman pleasure. And the most important cluster of nerve endings for women are in theclitoris, and you don't need a penis to stimulate the clitoris.For guys who are attracted to guys, the truth is that giving pleasure to a man doesn't require a large penis either. If guys are having analsex, a large penis isn't necessary to reach the \"maleg-spot,\" theprostate. The prostate lies within a finger's reach inside theanus. In addition, some guys preferoral sexormutual masturbationto anal sex, and penis size really doesn't matter there either.But maybe most important\u2014sex isn't about competition (who's bigger, who's better); sex is about sharing, communicating,intimacyand pleasure. So the best partner is not the guy who has the biggest penis. The best partner is the guy who is best at communicating with his partner. He finds out what his partner's feelings are and shares his feelings. He learns how his partner likes to be touched (and what he or she doesn't like) and tells his partner what he likes and doesn't.It's not the size of your penis that makes you a \"real man\" or a good or bad partner; it's how you think and how you act."], ["What are the different kinds of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)?", "There are three different kinds of STDs: bacterial, viral and parasitic.Bacterial infections are caused bybacteria.

HSV-1, HSV-2 and HIV stay with a person for life and can be passed to partners even if there are no symptoms. In some cases, HPV and hepatitis B can be cleared from the body, but there are also times when they stay with a person for life. There is no cure for HIV.Parasitic infections are caused by parasites (tiny bugs) that live in thepubic hair. They includescabiesandpubic lice(\"crabs\"). They can be spread during skin-to-skin sexual contact and from sharing bath towels, bedding and clothing. Scabies and lice can be cured with prescription soap.&nbsp;"], ["I have a cold sore.

But the type of herpes that can cause cold sores is often spread between people who have never hadsex. In fact, most people get oral herpes from a relative or friend from a non-sexual kiss and a lot of people carry the virus, even if they never get the cold sores it causes.There are two types of herpes viruses\u2014oral and genital. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is the most common cause of oral herpes and herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) is the most common cause of genital herpes. HSV-1 and HSV-2 can both be transmitted from mouth to mouth, mouth togenitals, genitals to mouth and genitals to genitals. Herpes is also the only sexually transmitted disease (STD) that can be transmitted through kissing. Because it is possible to transmit herpes from the mouth to the genitals or the genitals to the mouth, using acondomordental damfororal sexcan help to prevent the spread of herpes, but if a person has sores outside of the areas protected by the latex, exposure can still happen.For more information on herpes testing, treatment and support, visit theAmerican Sexual Health Association's website.

Generally, anSTDtest involves a blood sample, aurinesample or a culture, by ahealth care provider.When you see your doctor or health care provider, find out exactly what you are being tested for, so you know whether there are any tests missing. For example, a person is never automatically tested forHIV, thevirusthat causesAIDS. If your doctor or health care provider doesn't mention it, you need to request this test specifically and give permission to have it done.There are home test kits for HIV andHepatitis Cavailable at some drugstores and online. You have to prick your finger and send the blood sample to a lab to be tested. You call the lab a few days later for results. They also provide anonymous counseling over the phone. One brand name isHome Accessand currently costs around $45. However, we highly recommend going to a clinic for HIV testing. Just in case you test positive, it is much better to have some immediate support, like someone knowledgeable and caring who can talk to you about it.

For people who are trans, this can seem like an even bigger challenge.Start by thinking about what's behind your question. Are you hoping to become good friends? Or more? Do you feel that not telling this person about yourgender identityis unfair or dishonest? Do you want this person to know more about you so you feel closer and more understood? Are things becoming more serious and you want to talk to your friend now to avoid embarrassment or a surprise later on? Or maybe you think this person may already sense there's something more you want to tell them and you want to set the recordstraight.Before you take action, you might want to consider the following:Do you expect that the conversation will be kept private? How will you feel if it isn't?Consider the best possible outcome as well as the worst. How will you feel, realistically, if each one happens? Are you willing to accept those outcomes, and others that you might not have anticipated?What are you hoping will happen if you tell this person? What if that doesn't happen?Here are some suggestions if you decide you want to tell this person you're trans:Find the right time and place. Because many people assume there are only two genders, someone may be surprised to have their understanding challenged. Pick a place and a time that is private, but not isolated, where you won't be interrupted, but where there are other people in case the situation becomes unsafe.Be prepared to give your friend some information. He or she might be surprised or curious and could benefit from some additional information about trans issues and time to absorb what you have to say. On the other hand, there are also people who know a lot abouttransgenderpeople, so be prepared for someone who might react with confusion or hurt by saying, \"Why did you take so long to tell me? Didn't you trust me?\"Have some patience. People's reactions can be very mixed\u2014surprise, fear, delight, disbelief, joy. Some people may also have a lot of questions like, \"Are you sure?\" or, \"How did you know?\" Remember that just as some trans people may take time to fully understand themselves, people who aren't trans may need time to understand their friends who are trans. Try to be patient and maintain open communication and remind the person of how important it is that you are sharing this part of yourself with them. Be ready to answer questions.If society builds an awareness and acceptance of the diversity ofgenderidentities, trans people who are \"out\" will become more common and understanding will increase.

Do all people with AIDS die from it?", "The human immunodeficiencyvirus(HIV) is a viral infection that usually leads to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). When people are first infected with HIV, they often have no symptoms or very mild symptoms. Later, the virus weakens the immune system, allowing specific infections and diseases to occur. At this point, the person is diagnosed with AIDS. People with an AIDS diagnosis still have HIV in their bodies, and if they have unprotectedsexor share needles, they can transmit the virus to someone else.Not all people with HIV develop AIDS. It's impossible to say how someone's body will respond to the infection, and there are different strains (kinds) of HIV. Most people with HIV, over time, get a weakened immune system that makes them more susceptible to infections and diseases that people with healthy immune systems typically don't get. People with HIV sometimes use medications to help build their immune system, decrease the amount of the virus in the body and to treat the different illnesses caused by HIV.For more information, check out the following sites:AIDS.govThe BodyWant to get tested for HIV?Find a clinic near you.And for more info, check out theSex, Etc. stories\"Does HIV Look Like Me?\"and\"I Have HIV\u2026but HIV Does Not Have Me.\"You might also want to read \"Love &amp; HIV: A Relationship That Works!\""], ["Does sex feel different with a condom?", "If you asked most people, they would say, \"Yes, it feels different with acondom\"\u2014but you'd get a range of descriptions.

Some girls and guys say that they feel distanced from their partners when they use condoms. But condoms protect you and your partner, so that can also make you feel closer.There are lots of brands and kinds of condoms out there. If you're worried about a different sensation or a condom ruining the experience, you might think about polyurethane condoms.

Finishing all of your medicine and following up with yourhealth care provideris the only way to be sure the infection is necessary to avoid passing the STD to another person.For viral STDs, such asherpesorHIV, taking some medications can help lower the risk of passing herpes or HIV to a partner, but there is still a chance you could infect a partner. Using condoms and otherlatex barriersduring oral, anal orvaginal sexwill help lower the chances even more. For example, certain medications used for treating herpes outbreaks can also help to reduce something called viral shedding. With herpes sometimes a person has symptoms\u2014such as blisters, itching or a tingling sensation\u2014when theviruscan be \"shed\" (passed) to a partner, even though the shedding isn't accompanied by signs or symptoms. Certain medications can reduce this shedding significantly though a person can \"shed\" the virus without any symptoms.While there are no guarantees, taking these medications and also using condoms and othersafer sexmethods every time you have oral, anal or vaginal sex is a good way to help prevent passing the virus to your partner.

Whether there's a risk forpregnancyor sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) really depends on how much clothing the people are wearing. If a couple keeps their clothes on, the risk of pregnancy or disease is zero.Sperm, viruses andbacteriacan't get through layers of fabric. Dry sex or body rubbing with no clothes on can be riskier. If a guy ejaculates on thevaginal opening, sperm can swim into her reproductive system and fertilize an egg if she recently ovulated. Also, some infections, such asherpesandHPV, can spread through skin-to-skin contact, even if thepenisisn't inserted into thevagina.Myth: You can get pregnant from givingoral sexto a guy.Truth: This is not possible. In order for pregnancy to happen,semenhas to get inside the vagina. From there, the sperm that are in the semen swim up through thecervixanduterusinto the fallopian tubes. If someone swallows semen, the semen goes through a totally different body system. However, it is possible to get sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) by giving or receiving oral sex (regardless of a person's sex), including herpes. If you and your partner plan to have oral sex, the safest way is to uselatex barriers, which even come in flavored varieties. It's also a really good idea for you and your partner to get tested for STDs before having oral, anal orvaginal sex.Myth: You can get pregnant if there is semen on a hand and it touches a girl's vaginal opening or is inserted into it.Truth: If someone has semen on his or her hand and then touches the vaginal opening, it ispossiblefor a girl to get pregnant, though not verylikely. The risk isverylow. To potentially cause a pregnancy, the semen would still need to beweton the hand because that is the only way sperm stay alive. Sperm also cannot live long outside of the body. The best way to prevent pregnancy is to wash your hands or even wipe them off so that your hands are dry. This way, pregnancy isn't possible.Myth: You can't get pregnant if you have sex in certainpositions.Truth:This is a myth! It doesn't matter what position you're in. Any time semen is inside of or right outside of the vagina, a pregnancy is possible. To prevent pregnancy you must use a reliable method ofbirth controlevery time you have sex. Keep in mind that pregnancy isn't the only thing you have to be worried about. Besides condoms, the methods that work best to prevent pregnancy don't do anything to prevent STDs. So it's best to use condoms\u2014and, for really good protection, to use condoms and another method like the Pill or Shot.Myth: You can prevent pregnancy bydouchingafter sex.Truth: Douching can't prevent pregnancy. In fact, it can actually increase the chances of a girl getting pregnant. Douching is when a girl uses a solution of water and some mild cleanser to wash out the inside of the vagina. The fluid is usually in a squeezable bottle with a long neck that can be inserted into the vagina and then the fluid is pushed up inside. If a girl or woman douches right after sex, the force of the douche liquid can push the semen further into a girl's body, increasing the chance of pregnancy.Myth: If you pee after sex you can't get pregnant.Truth: You can still get pregnant if you urinate (pee) after sex. Urinating after intercourse will not prevent pregnancy.Urinecomes out of theurethra, which is a separate opening from the vagina. The urethra and the vagina are not connected. Since penile-vaginal intercoursehappens when a penis is inserted into the vagina, urinating after sex doesn't prevent pregnancy.Myth: You can get pregnant if a guy cums in a pool or Jacuzzi while you're in it.Truth: No. If semen is ejaculated into a pool, hot tub, Jacuzzi or bathtub, the sperm will be diluted in the water or killed by the heat, soap or chemicals. There is no chance of pregnancy. But, if you have vaginal intercourse in a Jacuzzi, pool, hot tub or bathtub\u2014where the penis is in the vagina\u2014pregnancy is definitely possible. Sperm swim quickly up the vagina and the water can't get inside and wash it away.Myth: You can't get pregnant the first time you have sex.Truth: It's possible to get pregnant anytime you have vaginal sex, whether it's the first or the 100th time. Even if a girl has not gotten her period yet, it's possible that she's about to start having it, and if this is the case, she has ovulated. When an egg and sperm are present, pregnancy is possible.

Other people think it means going through the motions of sexual intercourse without taking off some or all of your clothes.Dry sex can give you sexual pleasure and orgasms, so it's definitely a type of sexual activity. But there's less risk than with sexual intercourse. It's a good idea to talk beforehand about how far you want to go and havesafer sexsupplies (like condoms and dental dams) nearby just in case.For a guy and girl couple, dry sex with clothes on can't result in apregnancy. Ifejaculationhappens while wearing clothes, then there is no way for thespermto get through the clothes and into thevagina. This form of dry sex also carries no or very low risk for sharing sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).If there are no clothes on, however, andsemencomes in contact with the opening of the vagina, pregnancy is possible.This form of dry sex, no matter the sex of the partners, also carries a risk for many STDs. Some STDs such asherpesandHPVcan be passed through skin-to-skin contact. This means that if a partner has a herpes sore on their upper thigh or in their groin region, and they rub this part of their body on their partner'sgenitals, herpes can be transmitted. This is why discussing sexual histories is important, as is getting tested for STDs regularly.Find a clinic near you."], ["How do I know if I have a healthy or unhealthy body image?", "Answer these questions and then read on to find out what your answers say about yourbody image.1.

That can mean helping around the house, doing well in school, being respectful, establishing trust and making good choices in all areas of your life to show maturity.It can also be useful to talk with your parents to understand where they're coming from.

Is it really sex?", "Oralsexis when a person uses their mouth to sexually stimulate thegenitalsof another person. Oral sex performed on a female usually means licking or sucking theclitorisand other parts of thevulva(external genitals). It's also calledcunnilingus. You've probably heard it called \"eating out.\" Oral sex performed on a male can mean sucking or licking thepenis. It's calledfellatio. You've probably heard it called other things, like \"blow job.\"Slang words can be confusing because their meanings are not always clear. For example, \"blow job\" has nothing to do with blowing; \"eating out\" does not involve chewing. And certain slang words may be offensive to some people.There is no \"right\" way to perform oral sex on someone because different people enjoy different things. The specifics need to be explored by each pair of people with a little creativity and a lot of honest communication. That means you have to try different things and ask your partner what they like or don't like.Oral sex can give physical pleasure and orgasms, so it's definitely a sexual behavior. Some people think oral sex is really intimate and means two people are really close to each other. Others see it as less intimate thanvaginal intercourse. Everyone has to decide for themselves whatvaluesthey place on each sexual behavior. The important thing is to stay true to yourself and do things that feel comfortable for you.Oral Sex and Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs)It's important to know the potential risks that come with any sexual behavior. STDs can be transmitted if partners are having unprotected oral sex. Some people like the idea of allowing a partner toejaculatein their mouth or swallowing their partner's vaginal fluids; others are completely turned off by the idea. But anytime pre-ejaculatory fluid,semenor vaginal fluids enter the body, whether through the mouth or another opening, there's a risk of transmitting anSTDif either partner has one. It's tough to tell whether a person has an infection. Sometimes, people have infections and don't even know it. One way to reduce your risk of an STD when giving (or receiving) oral sex is to use a latex barrier, like a flavoredcondomor adental dam.With knowledge of the risks, it's equally important to consider your own comfort with the behavior in general. You get to decide what's comfortable for you; don't let a partner talk you into something that's not OK with you. You should never feel pressured to do something in a sexual situation. If you don't feel comfortable and safe, the experience will not be pleasant for you and will likely not be pleasant for your partner, either."], ["Will my child wonder why I chose adoption?", "It's certainly possible that one day your child will have questions.

What if we disagree?", "In many relationships, especially when they're healthy and communication is open, the partner is the first to find out after a girl or woman learns of herpregnancy. In a situation like that, they can discuss options and he may have some influence on what happens. However, legally, when it comes down to the final decision, you do not have a say. Under the law, the pregnant girl or woman gets to decide what to do about the pregnancy, whether it'sabortion, adoption or raising the child. That's her legal right.Some girls and women want the father of their baby involved in the decision; others do not. There are a variety of relationship and personal reasons why either of these might be the case.Some Things to Consider:Think about how you feel about the pregnancy and the idea of becoming a dad. Do some soul-searching. Guys have different reactions when hearing the news initially. Some are shocked. Others are happy. Others are confused. Others are stressed and wonder how they could manage being a father right now. It's important to work through whatever feelings you have, perhaps with someone close to you, before you talk to her. When you talk to her, listen to how she feels and what she wants. Ask questions. Calmly tell her how you feel. Answer her questions.If the two of you disagree about what to do, don't try to pressure her to accept your point of view. Once you know that she understands your side, even if she disagrees, take some alone time for both of you to think. Agree on a time to come back together and discuss it again.It's also important for you to spend some time figuring out how you feel about the child's mother. How would you define your relationship with her? Are you together as a couple? Are you just friends? Are you barely speaking? What kind of relationship would you like with her in the future? After you've had some time to yourself, it can be helpful to talk things through with a trustedadultin your life.Ultimately, the decision about what to do about a pregnancy is the girl's decision. When she makes a final decision it's best to start thinking about the next steps, not only for you personally, but also for your relationship. Once you work out the type of relationship the two of you want, you can focus on figuring out ways to handle the situation together. That includes dividing up responsibilities.

It's also a good choice for girls who take medicines that interfere with the effectiveness of the Pill, likeantibioticsthat are long-term.

What is the clear fluid that comes out of a guy's penis before he ejaculates?", "Typically, about a teaspoon ofsemenis released when a guy ejaculates. If he ejaculates often, the amount usually decreases. That's normal since it takes about five to seven days for a guy to produce enough semen for a fullejaculation.

There will always be some fluid withspermreleased; remember, it only takes one sperm to fertilize an egg!The fluid that comes out before ejaculation is called pre-ejaculatory fluid orpre-cum, and it comes from the Cowper's gland inside a guy's reproductive system. It's released to clean out the inside of theurethrawhen a guy gets anerection. The urethra can have leftoverurinein it from an earlier trip to the bathroom, and urine is acidic enough to be unfriendly to sperm.Pre-ejaculatory fluid makes the urethra less acidic and gives the sperm a better shot at surviving the trip through the urethra. Pre-ejaculatory fluid can contain sperm in some guys. Whether or not a guy's pre-ejaculatehas sperm depends on the guy and every guy is different.

That's why it's important to find a trustedadultto talk through what you're feeling. If you can't or don't accept a piece of yourself, it can affect all areas of your life. Coming to terms with how you feel and integrating it into who you are is a difficult process, and regardless of orientation, it's usually a process that requires support along the way.You might also be in a situation where you're pretty sure of your orientation but still have some doubts. That's OK. It's normal not to have all the answers! For most people, understandings about sexual orientation change throughout life. Our society generally accepts beingheterosexualas \"normal.\" That puts a lot of pressure on lesbian, gay and bisexual people to suppress their true feelings and try to fit in.

Through research, the American Psychological Association has found that these approaches are unlikely to be successful and involve some risk of harm.

What will happen when I go to the gynecologist?", "What happens during a visit to thegynecologistdepends on the reason you are going.If you aren't having a problem and you just wantbirth control, then you may not need to get undressed for an exam. When you call to make the appointment, feel free to ask your doctor or nurse if you will need apelvic examorPap test, both of which would require you to get undressed. If your doctor recommends an exam for another reason, then you will probably go through most, if not all, of the following steps.The ExamFirst, you'll be asked to fill out a medical history form. Then, a clinician will talk to you privately about your sexual history. The questions can feel a little bit uncomfortable to answer, but it's really important to answer each one completely and honestly. That's the only way yourhealth care providercan give you the information and services you need. Your medical records and history are usuallyconfidential, meaning your health care provider won't tell anyone, like your parents, but you should check with the gynecologist you visit. Being open will help your gynecologist offer you the best care. Doctors, nurses or other health care providers aren't there to judge you; they just want to give you the best medical care possible.After giving your medical history, you might be asked to provide aurinesample, using a plastic cup in the privacy of the bathroom. Next, you will go into an examination room, where you'll undress and put on a paper or cloth gown. Once you've changed, a health care provider will come into the room for the exam. If you would prefer a clinician of a particularsex, you can request that ahead of time. In many cases, a female nurse will be present in the room during the exam regardless of the sex of the health care provider who is performing your exam.Your gynecologist will listen to your heart and lungs, check your thyroid and may ask you to lie down for a breast exam. Some gynecologists may teach you how to examine your ownbreastsand feel for any unusual lumps or swellings that might need medical care. After the breast exam, the doctor will examine your abdomen, feeling the size and shape of your reproductive organs and check for anything unusual.Then, you'll be asked to lie on your back on the exam table and to slide down to the edge of the exam table and place your feet in what are called stirrups so that your legs are spread open. This position makes it easier for the gynecologist to examine thevulvaand check both inside and outside the vaginal area. She or he will use a bright light to see better. Usually, the gynecologist will check thelabiaand vulva for the general health of the skin.If you have been sexually active for at least three years or are 21 or older, the gynecologist will then insert a metal or plastic device called aspeculuminto thevagina. The speculum holds open the vaginal walls so the gynecologist can see thecervix, the tip and opening of theuterus, inside of the vagina. During this part of the exam, the doctor can also test for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). If the doctor tests for STDs, they usually use a long cotton swab to take a sample from inside the vagina and sometimes from the cervix.The gynecologist will also gently rub the cervix with something similar to a tongue depressor (but smaller) to collect some of the cells from the cervical opening and near it. These cells are examined under a microscope at a lab. This is called a Pap test, which tests for irregular cells on the cervix that could indicate a pre-cancerous condition. The Pap test is generally painless as the cervix does not have many nerve endings, but the experience can be different for all girls.After the Pap test, the gynecologist removes the speculum and inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into the vagina while gently pressing on the abdomen with the other hand. This is called a bimanual, which means \"two handed,\" exam. The gynecologist is checking the position and size of the uterus and ovaries to be sure everything is healthy.The pelvic exam shouldn't be painful, but some parts of it can feel a little uncomfortable. Try to relax and breathe deeply. It only lasts a few minutes. If you feel any pain, tell the gynecologist right away so she or he can work with you to make the experience as comfortable as possible.After the exam, before or after you get dressed, the gynecologist will ask if you have questions. This is when the gynecologist can prescribebirthcontrol or any other medications and address any of your health concerns.Doctors recommend that you get a checkup with a gynecologist between the ages of 13 and 15, and that you get a pelvic exam, which we will describe later, by the time you are 21 years old. This also includes girls who have sex with girls only. Visits to the gynecologist should continue every year of your life to ensure good health, although you may not need the entire exam every year.It may help you to read a personal account of ateen's first visit to a gynecologist.How to Find a GynecologistThe best way is to ask a parent, guardian or other trustedadult(maybe an aunt or older cousin) to recommend a doctor they trust. Maybe they'll even go with you on your first visit. If you do not want to see the same doctor as your parent or another adult you know, ask her gynecologist to recommend a colleague who is good with teens.Many health clinics are free or offer reduced (sliding-scale) fees to teens who don't have much money. For example, Planned Parenthood health centers offer low-cost,confidentialhealth care to teens. To find thePlanned Parenthoodnearest you, call1-800-230-PLAN (7526)orfind a clinic near you.Most health clinics keep these visits confidential and will not share a patient's medical information with anyone without permission, even if you're under 18.

But the reality is that many people do not acceptlesbian,gay,bisexualandtransgender(LGBTQ) people because they are not educated about it or are uncomfortable with something they're not used to. Unfortunately, this plays out in lots of places, including school. It can be called different things includingharassmentand bullying.Transphobia is the fear of anddiscriminationagainst transgender people and people thought to be transgender, regardless of their actualgender identity. Transphobia can lead to bias and even violence, which can make coming out as transgender even harder.Homophobiais the fear or dislike of people who are lesbian, gay or bisexual. When this fear and dislike is directed at bisexual people, it's called biphobia.Students who experience harassment in school often feel very isolated and are afraid to tell anyone what's happening. They may feel like they will be further harassed if they tell, or they may not want to tell people because it's embarrassing. Some students stop going to school because they think it's the only way to avoid the harassment. This can affect learning, grades and social relationships. This is why it's important to tell someone.It's never OK to harass another person. No one has the right to hurt another person, emotionally or physically. And no one should be discriminated against because of race,gender, age, physical abilities,sexual orientationor any other part of their identity.Here are some ways these phobias can have an impact on how people treat others:Calling a guy a \"fag\"Writing insults on the locker of a girl who the rumor mill says is bisexualForcing a guy to havesexwith a girl to prove he's not gayRaping a girl who identifies as lesbian to \"turn her\"heterosexualStripping a transgender person to reveal that person'sgenitalsand challenging their identityHitting or hurting someone because she or he is gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgenderThis type of behavior is always wrong.If you are being harassed, here are some steps you can take:1. Find a teacher or administrator that you particularly trust or who has reached out to you in the past. Talk to him or her about how you are feeling, specifically what it feels like when students make homophobic or transphobic comments and when teachers don't say anything.If your teacher seems interested and asks how he or she can help, here are some suggestions:Ask the teacher to research the school's harassment policy and share it with the rest of the faculty. If the policy doesn't specifically include harassment based on perceived or actual orientation or gender identity, ask the teacher to consider advocating for an updated policy. You could get other students involved in this, too.Help organize a training for teachers on LGBTQ issues at school. Ask the speakers who come to the training to talk about homophobia, transphobia and the differences between sexual orientation, sexual identity, gender identity and what it means to be transgender.Ask him or her to talk to other teachers about the harassment taking place and their required role in responding to the harassment.Help start a gay-straightalliance (GSA) so that an entire team of students can change the climate at your school to be more aware of homophobia and transphobia.2. Do some research. If your state school system has adopted \"Safe Schools\" laws, then this harassment must be stopped by the school administrators. Check out Sexetc.org'sSex in the Statesto review the laws in your state. Be sure to follow the link in the sources for updates.3. Go straight to the top and talk to your principal. You could try to talk to him or her about this harassment or bullying and ask that it be addressed in a staff meeting with teachers. If you want to do some research on this topic before you talk to your principle, then try these websites:Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education NetworkandLambda Legal.Think through all the adults you know who support you, pick one and tell them what's happening at school.

If it is not, sperm can still enter her cervix and fertilize an egg if one is present.The Today Sponge is effective between 80 to 91 percent of the time, if used perfectly. With typical use it is 76- to 88-percent effective.

How can they practice safer sex?", "People who identify aslesbian,gay,biorheterosexualcan give and express pleasure in many ways. There isn't just one way for two people to havesex, no matter what sex orsexual orientationthey are.What two people of the same sex do to have sex together depends on what feels good for them. Often, people think that sex is only putting apenisinto avagina, but that may not be the activity that brings the most pleasure to the two people. This is true for heterosexual,bisexual, lesbian and gay people.Males who identify as gay, bisexual or just do sexual things with other males may use their fingers (manual stimulation), mouths (oral sex) and various body parts to give and receive pleasure. They may kiss, touch each other's bodies or touch the penis and other areas including thescrotumor theanus. Sometimes they use penises to penetrate the anal opening (anal sex).Females who identify as lesbian, bisexual or just do sexual things with other females may touch each other'sgenitalsby using their fingers (manual stimulation), mouths (oral sex) and various body parts. They may kiss, touch each other'sbreastsor touch theclitorisand other areas of the vagina or the anus. Sometimes they use their fingers to penetrate thevaginal openingor to penetrate the anal opening (anal sex). Some also rub their vulvas together.It is possible to transmit sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) through many of these practices, so it is important for people who have partners of the same sex to read up onsafer sex. It is important to use acondomfor oral sex performed on a male and for anal sex, and to use adental damor a condom that is cut length-wise to create a sheet of latex to use as a barrier when performing oral-anal stimulation or oral sex on a female.When two people can communicate well, they can experience a wide range of sexual activities that are mutually agreed on, pleasurable and creative.

What can I do?", "It's tough when relationships end, whether or not you are the person who ended it. And it's even harder when you didn't want it to end or it was unexpected. Sometimes relationships end, even if strong feelings exist between two people. A couple might discover they have differentvaluesor needs in their lives that just don't fit with the relationship anymore. Sometimes, like when one partner goes to college, couples have to live far apart, and the relationship can't survive the distance or the differences between high school and college. Other times, two people have differences that make the relationship unhealthy for one or both. And sometimes, the connection and feelings fade.Give yourself time to grieve and feel whatever emotions come with the change in your life. It's hard to say how much time you'll need before you feel better. Some people need a long time, while others bounce back pretty quickly. While it may not seem like it now, the feelings will become less intense with time.For now, take care of yourself. Spend time with family and friends; talk to people who you know care about you. It can be helpful to find new things to do, like clubs, sports or other activities where you can meet new people and take your mind off of the change in your life. Being with friends and exploring new interests can help you focus on you and what's important to you. You can use this experience to make choices about who you want to get into a relationship with in the future.For now, you may want to read \"Ten Ways to Know You're Over Your Ex\" by staff writer Jen Levy."], ["My partner is pressuring me to take drugs or get drunk before we have sex.

Alcohol can make someone feel less uncomfortable and less inhibited\u2014which can be really bad in a sexual situation. Ask yourself why a partner is pressuring you to take illegal and potentially dangerous drugs, during sex or otherwise. In a healthy relationship, people exhibit respect for each other; this includes not asking a partner to do things that are harmful. This may be a good time to re-examine your relationship and to decide whether it is healthy for you to remain in it.People become less uncomfortable when they drink because alcohol slows down their brains. Alcohol makes it harder to make a decision about whether you really want to do something sexual. It also lowers inhibitions, which means that it becomes easier (in the moment) to do something you wouldn't do when you're sober. You still have to deal with the decision you made when you get sober, and that's a hard situation for lots of teens who've done things when they're drunk. The same is true for drugs, since they make you feel differently and can help you to make different decisions than you would when you're not on them.Alcohol and other drugs can also make it difficult to remember how to use acondomor make it seem like it's no big deal to have sex with someone who's sexual history you don't know. In general, alcohol and other drugs make things seem less risky and easier to do.Binge drinking, defined as having five or more drinks in one sitting, can cause a \"blackout,\" which means you won't remember anything that happened, even if you seemed like you knew what you were doing at the time. There are people who've had whole sexual interactions with someone only to forget and later find out from someone else that it happened. Imagine how that might feel. Not to mention, legally, no one, male or female, young or old, in a committed relationship or a one-time hookup, canconsentto sex while under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs.Tell your partner you don't want to take the chance of hurting yourself or getting in trouble.

Therefore, she needs to look at her own life circumstances to make the decision that is best for her.Here are some questions a girl who is faced with an unplanned pregnancy can ask herself. The answers can help her determine which decision is best for her.How do I feel about abortion? How do I feel about adoption? How do I feel about having a baby now?What are my goals for the next year? Five years? Ten years?How would having a baby now affect these goals?Where am I in school? Do I plan to finish high school and go to college? How would having a baby affect this?What is my financial situation?\u00a0How would my choice affect me financially?What kind of social support do I have in my life?Regardless of what a girl chooses to do, it's best to make a decision as soon as possible. If she chooses to place her baby with an adoption agency or to become a parent, she needs to see a health care professional for prenatal visits. If she chooses adoption, she should begin the process of selecting an adoption agency. If she chooses to terminate the pregnancy by having an abortion, it should be done as early in the pregnancy as possible.How do I tell my parents?Find a time and place where you can talk privately with your parent(s) or guardians.You can bring a friend or other adult along to support you if you think that might make it easier for you.

Then, just tell them.Parents orguardiansof teenagers have a variety of reactions to news of a pregnancy. By the time you tell them, you've probably had some time to adjust to the idea of pregnancy yourself. Your parent(s) or guardian(s) may need a similar adjustment period. In the end, the majority of parents or guardians want what is best for their child, and when it comes to a pregnancy, it's no different.You know your parent(s) or guardian(s) and your situation the best, and while many girls will feel nervous or scared about having this conversation with their parent(s) or guardian(s), some may just have a sense that it's not safe for them to talk to their immediate family. If you feel like it would be unsafe to share about your pregnancy with your immediate family, it might help to talk with another trusted adult\u2014like a teacher, counselor, health care professional, community leader or relative\u2014about your situation beforehand.

When an orgasm happens, the body releases all of this tension, resulting in a pleasurable feeling. Some people say orgasms feel like a slow build-up with an intense moment of excitement. Others say their entire body tingles. Everybody feels different. People often experience their first orgasm throughmasturbation.Each person needs different things to have an orgasm. It's important to tell a partner what feels good and what doesn't. If partners don't communicate about what feels good, how else will they know? It's also pretty uncommon for both people to have an orgasm at the same time, unlike what you might see in movies.When a male has an orgasm, it usually happens very close to anejaculation.

Remember that being sexual includes lots of behaviors, not just sex.A physical disability does not make a person any less sexual than anyone else.

The fluid makes the urethra less acidic and givessperma better chance of surviving the trip through the urethra and into his partner'svagina.One scenario where a guy's pre-cumcould contain sperm is if there are live sperm inside a guy's urethra (because he has ejaculated recently). The pre-cum can \"pick up\" the leftover sperm on its way through the urethra and out of the penis. If a guy pees after he ejaculates, that would kill leftover sperm. So, say a guy hassexand cums at 9 p.m. He doesn't go to the bathroom after he has sex. At 10 p.m., he gets another erection and pre-cum fluid is released. That fluid can have live sperm in it. Is it enough sperm to get a girl pregnant? Possible, but not likely.A recent study found that some guys always have sperm in their pre-ejaculatory fluid, and some guys never do. It really just depends on how that particular guy's body works. It is impossible to tell (other than in a lab) who's pre-cum has sperm in it or whose doesn't.

How do you think they'll react?", "This is a tough decision to make and, ultimately, only you will know if and when you should tell your parents. ButParents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG), an organization with chapters all over the U.S., offers some tips.PFLAG says manylesbianandgayteens thatcome outto their parents feel closer to them afterward because the relationship is more honest. They feel relieved not to be keeping such a big part of themselves a secret anymore.But sometimes parents aren't so understanding. Some parents force their teens to leave home. Some get abusive. And some family relationships are never the same.Before you come out to your parents, think about a few things:How do your parents react to gay people in general? Listen to what they say about lesbian, gay andbisexualpeople and ask some indirect questions.Do they have any lesbian, gay or bisexual friends?Do they read books or go to movies that include same-sexrelationships?Does their religion accept lesbian, gay and bisexual people?Have you heard them say negative things about lesbian, gay or bisexual people?And think about your relationship with your parents.Do they showlovefor you, even when they're mad at you?Are they supportive of you, even when you do things they don't like?Honestly answering these questions should help you gauge your parents' reaction to telling them you're gay, lesbian or bisexual. If you think they will take it so badly they might throw you out of the house, then don't tell them until you have a safe place to stay. You might even decide never to tell them because they won't understand. Trust your gut.

Is this possible?", "Yes, it's possible to be intimate with someone without havingsex(vaginal, anal or oral). As you get to know a partner, you will discover lots of things that feel good and make you feel closer, but that don't necessarily include havingsexual intercourse. These can be physical things, like touching and kissing, as well as non-physical things, like talking and sharing experiences together.Intimacyis when two people can be themselves and share their thoughts, feelings and emotions and be vulnerable without being afraid they will be laughed at or judged.Intimacyis an important element in a healthy relationship that involves sharing a feeling of emotional closeness with another person. When we have emotional intimacy, it's more comfortable to have physical closeness with that person. This is known as physical intimacy; it's not necessarily sexual.Sexcan be a part of an intimate relationship, but friendships and other relationships can be intimate and never sexual. Even romantic partnerships can be intimate and not include sex. Intimacy can take a while to achieve; it usually occurs in committed, long-term relationships, romantic or otherwise. Intimacy between two people who trust and care for each other can be wonderful.The most important thing to do is talk with your partner before things get physical. Be very clear about what kind of touching is allowed and what's off limits. So, is kissing OK, but not other touching? Is touching above the waist OK, but not below? If you do not want to have sex but want to be physical, make a promise to each other that things will stop at a certain point. Then agree that both of you are responsible for sticking to those limits. The last thing you want is for sex to \"just happen,\" which is how some people end up facing an unplannedpregnancyor sexually transmitted\u00a0diseases (STDs)."], ["My breasts don't look like the other girls' that I've seen in the locker room.

It might be because you're used to masturbating or havingsexin a certain way. Maybe you're with a new partner and you need time to get used to being with that person. Drugs and alcohol can also make it harder for a guy to ejaculate.Try talking to your partner about what feels good and remember thatejaculationdoesn't have to be the ultimate goal of having sex.

Can we stop using condoms?", "It's great that you're usingcontraceptionand that you've been tested for STDs. That shows that you're taking responsibility for your sexual health. We recommend that you continue to use male or female condoms for two reasons.First, thebirth controlpill is good at preventingpregnancyas long as you take it at about the same time every day. If you forget to take the Pill, the chance of pregnancy increases, so condoms give you extra protection. In addition, the Pill is not 100-percent effective; even if you take it consistently, there's still a slight chance of pregnancy. Therefore, using the Pill and acondomeach time you havesexreduces the chance of pregnancy.Secondly, thebirthcontrol pill does not provide protection from STDs. Research shows that many teens begin relationships using condoms and birth control, but then stop using condoms later on. At this point, they are unprotected from STDs, and while they think their partner isn't with anyone else, sometimes people cheat. Obviously this doesn't apply to everyone, but with the added benefit of increased pregnancy protection, why not keep the condoms in the picture? Also, many times STDs don't have any symptoms, and you or your partner may just be a carrier so you don't know theSTDis present. It's best to protect each other from the possibility of pregnancy or STDs.Got a question about STDs?

Are there any risks?", "Analsexis when apenisor other object is inserted into a partner'sanus. Like any other sexual behavior, some people find it very pleasurable and others don't. Some people are curious about it, and others know it's not something they're comfortable with. There is nothing wrong with engaging in anal sex, but whether it is right for you is something only you can decide.Since the anus is not capable of producing its own lubrication (as thevaginacan) and the tissue of the anus is very fragile, it is important that additional water-soluble lubrication (a variety of brands are available at drugstores) be used during anal sex. Without lubrication, there may be pain, discomfort and tearing of the tissue in the anus. Duringanal intercourse, as with any other type, comfort and relaxation are important for a pleasurable experience. When inserting a penis into the anus, go slowly and stop if there's pain or resistance. It's best if a person empties the bowels (poops) before anal intercourse and washes well before and after anal sex or oral-anal contact.Couples who engage in anal intercourse need to know that it is one of the ways thatHIVcan be spread sexually. This is because the lining of the anus is prone to tearing if there is not enough lubrication. This creates small tears in the anus where it is easier for HIV to get in. As with any other type of sex,safer sexis absolutely necessary during anal sex. There are lots of ways to reduce the risk of getting or giving a sexually transmitted disease (STD) from anal sex. For example, you can use acondomon the penis or your finger if you're performing anal penetration with your finger. You can also use afemale condomon the penis for insertion in the anus. For oral-anal contact, you can use adental damover the anal area.People have a lot of different feelings about anal sex. Some people think that only those who identify asgayhave anal sex. But that's not true. Anal sex can and is practiced by both gay andheterosexualcouples. At the same time, some gay couples and some heterosexual couples don't engage in anal sex.If heterosexual couple are having anal sex, they should never put the penis into the vagina after it has been in the anus without changing the condom or washing the penis first. Thebacteriain the anus can cause severe vaginal infections. In addition, regardless of the sex of each partner, after the penis has been in a partner's anus, it should never be inserted into a partner's mouth without changing the condom or washing the penis off first. Just as bacteria in the anus can cause severe vaginal infections, it can also cause oral and intestinal infections. It is also possible to get pregnant through anal sex ifsemenruns out of the anus into the opening of the vagina, which is not far away\u2014which is another good reason to use a condom.Before engaging in anal intercourse, make sure that you and your partner have discussed and agreed upon it. Never pressure someone or let someone pressure you into having any kind of sex."], ["Can guys be raped, too?", "Yes. Often, people hear the words \"rape\" or \"sexual assault\" and automatically figure the victim is female. This isn't always true. Males can be raped. Also, females canrapepeople. Regardless of how rape is defined legally, being forced to do something sexually that you did not agree to is always wrong and can have lasting effects, regardless of yoursexor the sex of the person who raped you.A guy can be penetrated by apenisor object, anally, for example. And despite what some people think, a guy can also be forced to havevaginal intercourse. Just because a guy has anerectiondoesn't necessarily mean that he wants sex. Anerectionis simply a response to stimulation\u2014a normal, involuntary reaction that the body has\u2014and it sometimes can happen out of fear, shock or for no clear reason at all.It's hard for anyone to report rape orsexual assault. A guy might feel like he's not a \"real man\" if he was raped, or he may feel like no one would believe him because he's been taught that guys should always want and have sex if the situation arises. If the person who rapes him was a male, he might worry the rape \"made himgay.\" Or he may worry that others will think he'sgay. If a gay orbisexualguy is raped by another guy, people sometimes think that he was \"asking for it\" or that he's making it up. These are all examples of myths that are out there that can make it even more difficult for guys who have been raped to get help. Just like anyone who has experienced rape, guys have nothing to feel guilty about or ashamed of if they are raped. It's not their fault.Someone guilty of rape\u2014whether they are male or female\u2014has hurt another person physically and psychologically and broken a law.

For asexual people, attraction or wanting to form some sort of relationship\u2014romantic or otherwise\u2014has nothing to do with how attractive a person is, but is more about a desire to get to know a person. Some asexual people have romantic relationships and others don't. Some asexual people masturbate, engage in sexual behaviors with a partner and feel arousal, though it is not directed at another person. Some asexual people do not masturbate or engage in sexual behaviors with a partner. They may not experience arousal but do not see this as a problem that would need to be fixed.

Are there any risks?", "Yes, there are some risks. If you work with a physician, then you can minimize the risks. Do not believe everything you read on websites about hormones. The most accurate information can be gathered by talking to atrans-friendly health professional. TheGayandLesbianMedical Association (GLMA)can help you find one. We recommend that you consider hormones when you can legally do so\u2014that is, when you are 18 or with a parent's permission if you are under 18.Sometransgenderpeople decide to use hormones, or younger trans people might usepubertyblockers to prevent them from going through puberty for thesexthey were assigned atbirth, to have their bodies more closely match theirgenderidentities. Others choose not to take hormones and instead use clothing to express the gender they feel inside. Still others decide that a combination of these options will help them achieve the body that most closely matches how they feel inside.Each person has to make the best choices for him or herself, so it's important to get good, accurate information. It is also very helpful to identify people in your life who can help you think things over. A trusted, supportiveadultwho cares about you\u2014like a parent or guardian, family member, close adult friend, clergy person, counselor or medical provider\u2014can be a great help in thinking things through.Hormones cause big changes in a person's body, so it's important to know all of the facts.TestosteronePeople who were born female may choose to take testosterone to make their physical appearances look more masculine. Testosterone will cause some sex characteristics typical of males. Changes can include the following:A deeper voiceRedistribution of fat and muscle tissueGrowth of hair on the body and faceChanges in skin textureGrowth of theclitorisAcneBaldness, even for younger peopleInterruption of periodIncreased sex driveEstrogenPeople who were born male may choose to take estrogen to make their physical appearances look more feminine. Estrogen will cause some sex characteristics typical of females to start. These can include the following:Redistribution of fat and muscle tissueWidening hipsChanges in skin textureDevelopment of some breast tissueDecreased ability to achieve anerectionDecreasedtesticlesizeDecreasedspermproductionDecreased sex driveEstrogen will not raise your voice or shrink your Adam's apple.Because hormones are powerful drugs, they have to be prescribed by a physician. A family physician or endocrinologist may assist with preliminary exams and tests to make sure hormones will be safe for you to use. Again, having a trusted, supportive adult or adults help you figure out the medical system can be very important.There are some things that hormones will not change. Estrogen will not make a person'spenisor facial hair disappear. Testosterone will not make someone'sbreastsdisappear. Testosterone won't cause a person to grow testicles or produce sperm. Estrogen won't cause a person to grow auterusor ovaries or produce eggs. If you have any questions or worries about what hormones may do to your body, be sure to ask.Some of these changes are permanent. This means that even if the person stops taking hormones, some of the changes that they caused may not ever go away. It's important to think hard about this while deciding about hormones. Also, some side effects may be mild, while others might be life threatening.Some people may think about buying hormones on the street, or sharing a friend's hormones, or using other drugs or substances not from a doctor to try to make their bodies change. This can be very dangerous. Using other substances or using more hormones than are prescribed can be deadly. Using a higher dose than your doctor prescribes will not make your body change any faster. Using too much can actually work against the changes you are waiting for and be bad for your health.It is also important to use clean needles when using injectable hormones, sinceHIVand other viruses can be passed along with shared needles.Bottom line: Only hormones and treatments prescribed by a doctor and filled by a pharmacist can help you achieve the body you desire while balancing the potential risks.Find a trans-friendly health care professional near you."], ["Can I end my own pregnancy by falling down the stairs or drinking an herbal tea?", "No, you can't end your ownpregnancyby falling down the steps or using an herbal remedy.

There is a small risk for getting and givingHIVthrough oral sex, too.Anytime pre-ejaculatory fluid,semenor vaginal fluids enter the body, whether through the mouth or another opening, there's a risk of transmitting an STD if either partner has one.

Sometimes, people have infections and don't even know it.This doesn't mean that you can't enjoy oral sex. But it does mean that you need to plan ahead, talk to your partner and use protection. One way to make oral sex safer is to get tested for STDs regularly. Pay attention to any potential symptoms of STDs, and get them checked out by ahealth care providerright away.If you do not abstain from oral sex, using a latex barrier or othersafer sexmethod is your best chance of avoiding most STDs.

Many people think fingering is when someone puts a finger inside thevagina. Some people like this, and others may prefer it when someone rubs or strokes theclitoris, a small but sensitive organ just above thevaginal opening. Some people like both of these things.There is no \"right\" way to touch another person'sgenitals\u2014or your own\u2014because different things are pleasurable for different people. The specifics need to be explored by each person with honest communication. That means you may have to try different things and ask your partner what they like and what they don't.There's almost no risk ofpregnancyfrom fingering or hand jobs. If a person has dirty hands and touches another person's genitals, they can spread germs orbacteria. It's also possible, but not likely, to spread a sexually transmitted disease (STD) this way.

Inside the scrotum are the testicles (testes), which are two small organs that are sometimes called \"balls.\" It is normal for the testicles to hang unevenly, with one lower than the other (usually the left!). This actually helps them avoid knocking into each other. (Ouch!)Spermcells are made in the testicles, then stored in tubes nearby that are called theepididymis. Sperm need a specific temperature that is lower than body temperature to survive. Because of this, the testicles hang outside of the body in the scrotum, which regulates the testicular temperature. That's why when it's really warm, the scrotum relaxes and allows the testicles to hang lower, away from the warmth of the body, and when it's cold outside or when you're in cold water, the scrotum pulls the testicles close to the body to keep them warm.Thesexhormone,testosterone, is also produced in the testicles. Testosterone helps give men their certain traits\u2014deeper voices, more hair on the body and an enhanced ability to build muscles."], ["Is it normal to have hair \"down there\"? Should I shave my pubic hair?", "It's completely normal to have hair in the genital region; it's calledpubic hair. The hair usually grows on the \"mons pubis\" for a female and just above and around thepenisfor a male.Pubic hair provides warmth and padding for the genital area. It also traps dirt and germs that can get inside genital openings (vaginaorurethrafor females and urethra for males).Shaving your pubic hair is really a personal choice. There are plenty of girls and guys who don't shave their pubic hair and plenty who do. Something to be aware of is that when people shave their pubic hair, they usually itch while the hair grows back. Also, after shaving, this sensitive skin area can also become irritated and sore without hair covering it.If you do decide to shave, take a warm bath first, and use a new, clean razor. Most people find it helpful to use shaving cream or gel. Shave in the direction of the hair growth. When you shave against the direction of the hair growth, you are more likely to see irritated bumps or ingrown hairs afterwards. After shaving, you may want to put on some powder on the area you shaved. This will help avoid itching and irritation."], ["What are the different types of adoption?", "There are two types of adoptions:confidential(or closed) and open. Both thebirthand adoptive parents have to agree on what type of adoption they will have.In a confidential or closed adoption, the birth parents and adoptive parents never know each other. Adoptive parents are given some background and medical information about the birth parents, but they never meet or talk before or after the adoption is complete.In an open adoption, the birth parents and the adoptive parents know something about each other. They decide how much contact they'll have both before and after the adoption. In confidential adoptions, birth parents read about different adoptive families and choose the one they like best. Neither party knows the others' names. In adoptions that are more open, birth and adoptive parents talk over the phone and exchange first names. They might even decide to meet, usually at the adoption agency or an attorney's office.In some cases, birth and adoptive parents choose a completely open adoption. They know each other's names, addresses and phone numbers. They stay in contact by visiting, calling or writing each other. They may also allow contact between the child and the birth parents.Talk to your counselor about the type of adoption that is best for you. Do you want to help decide who adopts your child?

But, just because they are common and curable doesn't mean they aren't a big deal.The thing with chlamydia and gonorrhea is that they often have no symptoms in guys or girls, so it is often impossible to know if you have them, or if your sexual partner has them, unless you are both tested. They can be transmitted through vaginal, anal and\u2014although less likely\u2014oralsex.When guys get these bacterial infections, if they have symptoms, it hurts when they pee. They may experience swelling of the testicles or discharge from thepenis. Girls can have pain when they pee and an unusual discharge from thevagina. While not as common, it is possible to get chlamydia or gonorrhea in the throat, if you give oral sex to an infected person. It's also possible to get it in theanusor rectum through anal sex.Both chlamydia and gonorrhea can be cured withantibiotics. However, a person can transmit them to a partner until they have finished taking all of their antibiotics. And, even if you've been treated and cured of chlamydia or gonorrhea once, you can still get it again if you have sexual contact with an infected partner.If left untreated, they can cause severe infections in the reproductive system and can even cause sterility in guys and infertility in girls, meaning they'll be unable to have children down the road.

Latex and synthetic (polyisoprene or polyurethane) condoms have been tested and retested by manufacturers, researchers and are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to make sure people are getting great protection. When acondomis used correctly and consistently every time of you have oral, anal orvaginal sex, you are getting a lot of help at preventingpregnancyand/or the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).Condoms\u2014when used correctly and consistently\u2014prevent pregnancy about 98 percent of the time. The typical effectiveness rate\u2014where mistakes are made or condoms break\u2014is about 82 percent.Condoms also protect against STDs that are spread through bodily fluids (pre-cum,semen, vaginal fluids and blood). Those STDs includeHIV,gonorrhea,chlamydiaandsyphilis. Some STDs, likeherpesandgenital warts, are spread through skin-to-skin contact. A condom may not cover areas of the skin that are infected, such as thescrotum,labiaor even the inside of the thigh. So, condoms may not protect against the skin-to-skin transmission of these specific infections.Just check out these facts (and, for you skeptics, the research behind them):In a two-year study of couples in which one person was already infected with HIV and the other person wasn't, not one uninfected partner contracted HIV when the couple used condoms correctly each time they hadsex.Have you ever heard that condoms are porous, meaning that they have pores or tiny holes? This is partially true. Natural skin, natural membrane or lambskin condoms do contain small pores that may permit the passage of viruses, including HIV,hepatitis B, and herpes. However, more than 80% of male condoms commercially made in the United States are made of latex or synthetic latex and do not contain pores. Latex works to completely block small viruses andbacteriathat cause STDs. This means that even though viruses and bacteria are very small, they cannot pass through latex or synthetic condoms.Spermcan't pass through latex or synthetic latex condoms either.Using condoms lowers the risk of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and women's and girls' risk of developingcervical cancer, a disease associated with HPV.It can be overwhelming to look at rows of condom boxes and not know if they all work equally well. The most important distinction to make between condoms is the material they're made out of. Condoms can be made of latex, polyurethane, polyisoprene or natural skin (or \"lambskin\"). Only latex, polyisoprene and polyurethane condoms prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Most studies have been conducted on latex condoms, but for people who are allergic to latex, polyurethane or polyisoprene condoms are also a good choice. Some condoms are sold as novelty items which means they're for fun, not protection; the packaging will say if they are meant for protection as well.Types of CondomsLatex condoms are the most common and affordable. They're durable and usually won't rip if they are used with a water-basedlubricant, such as K-Y or Astroglide. Some major brands of latex condoms are Trojan, LifeStyles and Durex.Polyurethane or polyisoprene condoms can be harder to find. They're also very durable, and some people say these condoms provide even greater sensations than those made out of latex. Polyurethane and polyisoprene condoms are a great alternative for people with latex allergies and can be used with any kind of lubricant because this material does not break down as easily. The most popular brands of polyurethane condoms are Durex Avanti or Trojan Supra condoms.Natural skin condoms do not protect against STDs because they have tiny pores (holes) that can allow STDs to pass through. They do protect against pregnancy, and some people use them only for that purpose.There are also flavored condoms. These are designed to be used duringoral sex. STDs can be spread through unprotected oral sex or skin-to-skin contact if semen or vaginal fluid gets into a partner's mouth or if a partner touches an infected area that is not covered by the condom. The flavored latex condoms help reduce the risk of getting anSTDthrough oral sex. Flavored condoms shouldn't be used for vaginal or anal sex. The sugary substances that make them taste good can also cause infections. You can find flavored or polyurethane condoms in most drugstores or grocery stores.Female condoms are a soft, loose-fitting polyurethane or nitrile sheath and offer protection during vaginal and anal sex as well. This device has two flexible rings to hold it in place. The smaller ring goes inside thevaginaand holds it in place.

This can happen for different reasons.Sometimesantibiotics\u2014medicine taken for bacterial illnesses\u2014can actually lead to ayeast infection. That's because some antibiotics, while killing off \"bad\"bacteria, kill the \"good\" bacteria that keep yeast from growing too much. Changes inhormonelevels\u2014either frompregnancyor takingbirth control pills\u2014can also contribute to yeast infections. Yeast infections can also occur as a result of thevulvabeing damp for a long period of time (like staying in awetbathing suit or exercise clothes for a long time).Some girls get yeast infections more than others. To reduce the chances of getting one, avoid wearing very tight pants and non-cotton underwear and try not to stay in wet clothes (a bathing suit or sweaty exercise clothes) for too long. Also, after going to the bathroom, be sure to wipe from front to back because wiping from back to front may spread bacteria from theanusto the vagina and cause a yeast infection or aurinary tract infection(UTI).Usually, the first symptom of a yeast infection is redness and itching around the vulva and inside the vagina. There can also be white, thick, clumpy discharge that looks like cottage cheese but doesn't smell. The vulva can be tender and sore or it may hurt to pee or havesex.Yeast infections can usually be treated with antifungal creams or suppositories (medicine inserted into the vagina). This medicine can be bought without a prescription at most drugstores or supermarkets, but before you try to treat a yeast infection, visit yourhealth care providerto make sure you actually have a yeast infection. There are also prescription medicines available to treat a yeast infection that won't go away with medicines you can get in stores.Sometimes, though, a girl may think she has a yeast infection when in fact it may be a sexually transmitted disease (STD). This is because the symptoms of a yeast infection, like discharge from the vagina and burning and itching in the vagina or around the vulva, are also common symptoms of STDs. So even if you think you just have a yeast infection, it is best to speak with your health care provider to make sure it is not something more serious.Avoid having sex during a yeast infection. The medicine used to treat a yeast infection can weaken latex condoms and having sex while you have a yeast infection can make the infection worse. And although yeast infections are not considered an STD, a girl can pass a yeast infection to her sexual partner.

Talking openly and honestly with a partner about condoms and planning ahead of time how to protect each other from sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)and/or pregnancy is important.Ideally, you should talk about using protection, such as acondom, before you even start engaging in sexual behaviors. When you talk openly and honestly about your expectations, both you and your partner understand that if you do have sex, then you will be prepared to use protection.When you talk about using a condom, it doesn't necessarily mean that you have committed to having sex. It just means that protecting your sexual health is important to you. Even if you have decided to have sex but then realize that sex doesn't feel OK, you always have the right to say \"no,\" even at the last second. Partners need to respect the right of anyone at any time to change his or her mind.If you find that it is difficult for you to talk openly and honestly with your partner about using a condom, you might want to think about whether it's the right time for you to have sex.

They shouldn't cause anxiety around pregnancy if there is a low or no risk for pregnancy.You might want to think about what sexual behaviors you are ready to engage in, as well as what you are comfortable doing with a partner, and then talk about it with your partner. If you do not feel comfortable discussing this with your partner, think about why that is and decide if you're ready to be engaging in those particular sexual behaviors with your current partner.You may also want to talk to a trustedadultin your life about the anxiety you are feeling surrounding pregnancy.

Find a time to talk privately, preferably out of a sexual situation. Know what you want to say before you sit down to talk. You could start by telling your partner how you feel about your relationship. Discuss the things you like about your partner and the time you spend together. This will help your partner know that your decision to say no to certain sexual behaviors isn't a rejection; it's an important personal choice that you've chosen to communicate.Then explain why you don't want to do certain sexual things.

Be clear about this if you want to stay in the relationship. If you two are together because you really like and care for each other, then letting your partner know how you feel may help to bring you closer. There are a lot of ways to feel close to a partner besides having sex, and they're not all physical. This could be a great time to talk with your partner about what you are comfortable doing that would help you feel closer to your partner.An important part of being sexually healthy is knowing what yourvaluesand limits are when it comes to all kinds of sexual behavior.Valuesare the important things that matter to you and limits refer to how far you want a relationship or sexual situation to go. Once you know your values and limits, share them with your partner as part of a healthy relationship. People say no to a lot of things in relationships, not just sexual things.

However, in some girls, the outline of the implant may be visible. It may be possible to feel the hormonal implant in the arm.How well does it work?Implanon is highly effective, both in \"perfect use\" and \"typical use.\" Since girls don't have to remember to take a pill at the same time every day, there is very little room for error. In fact, Implanon is considered one of the most effective forms ofbirthcontrol available.

You can decide where you draw the line on what you want to do sexually.Once you've decided how you define abstinence, make it clear to your romantic partners that you're not interested in getting physical in these specific ways. You have to set specific limits if a relationship is getting romantic. You also have to be prepared for the possibility that your partner will have a different definition of abstinence than you, and that is the point when you either come to a compromise or decide that your boundaries are not a good fit for the other person. This is part of establishing and being in a healthy relationship.To succeed in sticking to your definition of abstinence, it's helpful to have supportive friends and family members.

Surgical abortions are the most common in the U.S. and use a procedure that removes the contents of theuterus. The process starts with a pelvic examination. Next, a shot of anesthesia, or pain killer, is applied to thecervix. Some choose general anesthesia, which basically means being put to sleep during theabortion.Once the anesthesia is applied, a tube is inserted into the cervix. The tube is used to remove the contents of the uterus with suction. The procedure takes five to 15 minutes. Cost ranges between $350 and $700, depending on where you go and how long you have been pregnant. Sometimes, for surgical abortions, a procedure calleddilationand curettage (D&amp;C) is also used. Later inpregnancy, another type of procedure called dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E) is used. Both D&amp;C and D&amp;E procedures remove what is inside of the uterus.Medical abortions, also called medication abortion or abortion by pill, are abortions performed with medicine. No surgery is used. They usually require two appointments with a clinician and they should be performed earlier in your pregnancy\u2014within the first nine weeks after your most recent period.On the first visit, the doctor will give youmifepristone(also known asRU-486). It works by preventing your body from producingprogesterone, ahormonethat is necessary for a pregnancy to continue. The clinician will instruct you when to take the second medication\u2014misoprostol. This causes the uterus to contract, which leads to a heavy period and a termination of the pregnancy. After taking both medications, it's important to return to the doctor's office once again to make sure the abortion is complete and there are no complications. Medical abortions are 95-percent effective and cost between $350 and $650, depending on where you live.Medical abortionis safe. It has been used inEuropean countriesfor over a decade and is widely recommended by doctors. But there are risks with any medical procedure, including medical abortion.There are few harmful effects from abortions, as long as they are performed by trained clinicians.

How do they work and how effective are they?", "Birth controlrefers to something that is used to preventpregnancy. There are so many methods available! They all fall into one of four different categories: hormonal, barrier, behavioral or spermicidal.Below, we explain what these different methods are, how they work and how effective they are\u2014when used correctly and consistently\u2014at preventing pregnancy. Whenbirthcontrol fails, it's usually because it wasn't used properly. Human error (\"Oops, I forgot my Pill!\") is a huge factor in whether birth control works or not. This is why manufacturers of drugs actually note two different rates of effectiveness for each birth control method. One rate is with \"perfect use,\" and the other is the \"typical use\" rate.Keep in mind that the effectiveness rates represent the number of couples who do not get pregnant out of a hundred. For example, condoms are 98-percent effective with perfect use, which means that if 100 couples correctly use condoms every time they havesex, 98 couples don't get pregnant and two do.Barrier MethodsBarrier methods (such as condoms or diaphragms) create a physical barrier betweenspermand the egg.CondomThese latex or polyurethane sheaths cover thepenisand prevent bodily fluids from transferring from one person to another. Condoms are effective in preventing pregnancy and the transmission of STDs.EffectivenessPerfect use: 98 %Typical use: 87 %How It WorksThe condom fits right over an erect penis and should be put on before engaging in any type ofsexual intercourse. This creates a barrier so no bodily fluids are exchanged between partners. This means sperm can't enter avaginato cause a pregnancy, if the couple is male-female. It also means partners are less likely to be at risk of getting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).Keep in MindCondoms are really effective at protecting against pregnancy and most STDs when they're used correctly. They are also cheap, easy to obtain and use and come in a variety of sizes, shapes and textures and flavors fororal sex. Use water-basedlubricantwhen engaging in vaginal or anal sex.Female CondomThe female condom\u2014also known as an internal or receptive condom\u2014is a polyurethane or nitrile sheath with flexible rings at the ends that help the condom stay in place.EffectivenessPerfect use: 95 %Typical use: 79 %How It WorksThe female condom is inserted into the vagina and held in by a ring that covers thecervix. On the other end is another ring that stays outside of the vagina, partly covering thelabia. Like themale condom, this creates a barrier that prevents the exchange of bodily fluids that could cause STDs or pregnancy.Keep in MindFemale condoms can be a bit tricky to insert, but anyone can get the hang of it with some practice. The female condom gets some major points because it can be inserted up to 8 hours before sex.Cervical CapThe cervical cap is a small latex, plastic or silicone rubber cup that covers the cervix\u2014the lower part of theuterus\u2014and prevents sperm from entering the uterus.Spermicidecan be placed on the inside and outside of the cap.EffectivenessPerfect use: 91 %Typical use: 86 %How It WorksThe cervical cap fits over the cervix\u2014the lower part of the uterus\u2014and keeps sperm from entering the uterus.Keep in MindYou have to visit a clinic or see ahealth care providerto be fitted for a cervical cap. Like diaphragms, cervical caps are most effective when used with spermicide. They are also reusable and must be washed and stored in a dry container. Cervical caps do not provide protection from STDs.DiaphragmThe diaphragm is a thin rubber or silicone dome with a springy, flexible rim that is held in place by the muscles in the vagina. It must be used with spermicides and should be inserted before engaging in any sexual behaviors. After intercourse, the diaphragm must be left in place for at least six hours to be effective.EffectivenessPerfect use: 94 %Typical use: 88 %How It WorksThe diaphragm works as a barrier that covers the cervix\u2014the lower part of the uterus\u2014 and keeps sperm from entering the uterus.Keep in MindWomen have to visit a clinic or see a health care provider to be fitted for a diaphragm. They are most effective when used with spermicide. Diaphragms are reusable; they must be washed and stored in a dry container. They do not provide protection from STDs.TodaySpongeThe Today Sponge is a single-use polyurethane sponge that contains spermicide. The sponge has a loop for easy removal.EffectivenessPerfect use: 80-91 %Typical Use: 76-88 %How It WorksThe Today Sponge fits over the cervix\u2014the lower part of the uterus\u2014and keeps sperm from entering the uterus, while the spermicide kills sperm.Keep in MindThe Today Sponge can be bought in drugstores. It must stay in place at least six hours aftervaginal sexto be effective. The Today Sponge is not reusable and does not provide protection against STDs.Hormonal MethodsHormonal methods (such as the Pill, the Patch and the Ring) use hormones to preventovulationand thicken cervical mucus, creating a barrier that can prevent sperm from entering the uterus. Without an egg, pregnancy can't happen. Hormonal methods of birth control are more than 99-percent effective. But that's only if they're used correctly and consistently.Birth Control Pill (the Pill)Often referred to as simply \"the Pill,\" this hormonal birth control method is a pill taken at the same time each day.EffectivenessPerfect Use: 99.7 %Typical Use: 93 %How It WorksThe Pill works by releasing synthetic hormones similar toestrogenandprogesterone. The Pill stops ovulation so no eggs are released. It also thickens cervical mucus to make it difficult for sperm to enter the uterus.Keep in MindThe Pill requires a prescription and a visit to a health care provider. The Pill must be taken every day at the same time. When taken with some drugs, such asantibiotics, the effectiveness may be lowered. The Pill does not provide protection against STDs.The ShotDepo-Proverais a shot that injects hormones into the body to prevent pregnancy for three months.EffectivenessPerfect Use: 99.8 %Typical Use: 94 %How It WorksThe Depo-Provera shot injects high levels of progestin, a synthetichormonesimilar to progesterone, into the body. This stops the ovaries from releasing eggs, thickens the cervical mucus and changes the lining of the uterus. Depo-Provera users get an injection (shot) once every three months in their upper arm or upper buttocks/lower back.Keep in MindThe Shot requires a prescription and a visit to a health care provider. It is effective after 24 hours and requires no daily attention. The Shot does not provide protection against STDs.ImplanonThis flexible rod is inserted into the body through a small incision in the upper arm. The rod is must be inserted by a healthcare provider and is about 1.5 inches long.EffectivenessPerfect use: 99.95 %Typical use: 99.95 %How It WorksImplanon is another device that releases progestin in order to prevent ovulation and thicken the cervical mucus.Keep in MindImplanon requires no attention for up to three years. It has to be inserted by a health care professional and requires an incision in the arm. Implanon does not provide protection against STDs.NuvaRing (the Ring)This small, soft, clear, flexible ring is inserted into the vagina once a month for three weeks with one week being ring-free whenwithdrawalbleeding similar to a period takes place.EffectivenessPerfect use: 99.7 %Typical use: 92 %How It WorksNuvaRing releases synthetic hormones similar to estrogen and progesterone, which prevents ovulation and thickens the cervical mucus.Keep in MindThe Ring only requires attention monthly, but it may be difficult to insert the ring until a girl or woman gets the hang of it. The Ring does not provide protection against STDs.The PatchOften referred to simply as \"the Patch,\" this thin, beige, smooth patch looks like an over-sized Band-Aid and is worn on a girl's or woman's buttocks, lower back, abdomen or upper arm.EffectivenessPerfect use: 99.7 %Typical use: 91 %How It WorksThe Patch releases synthetic hormones through the skin to prevent ovulation. After the girl or woman places the Patch on her skin, and it remains in place for one week. She replaces it once a week for three weeks in a row. On the fourth week, she removes the patch so that withdrawal bleeding similar to a period can take place. The next week, she applies a new patch and the cycle repeats.Keep in MindThe Patch does not provide protection against STDs. The Patch also delivers more hormones into the body than the Pill does. This can mean that girls and women who should not take estrogen-based products should not use the Patch. Talk with your health care provider to find out more.Behavioral MethodsBehavioral methods (such as abstaining from sex or using the withdrawal method) are ways that people change their sexual behavior and patterns in order to attempt to prevent pregnancy.AbstinenceThe only completely safe sex is no sex\u2014including vaginal, oral and anal sex.Effectiveness:100 %How It WorksNo intercourse whatsoever.Keep in MindResisting natural sexual urges can make it difficult to remain abstinent. For abstinence to be 100-percent effective, it requires that you not have any type of intercourse, including vaginal, oral and anal sex. When abstinence is used properly it prevents any risk of pregnancy or STDs.Coitus Interruptus(TheWithdrawalMethod orPulling Out)The withdrawal method. Pulling out. Call it what you like, it's all about getting the penis out of the vagina and away from thevulvabeforeejaculation.EffectivenessPerfect use: 96 %Typical use: 80 %How It WorksThis method works by removing the penis from the vagina before the male ejaculates so that sperm cannot enter the female's body.Keep in MindIt is a better form of birth control than none at all. It is always available when needed, but it is not very reliable. Many younger men may not be able to totally control their ejaculation and so run the risk of ejaculating too early or too close to the vulva. The withdrawal method offers zero protection against STDs.Spermicidal MethodsSpermicides are chemicals that kill sperm. They come in a variety of forms including gel, cream, foam, suppositories and film, which can be purchased in most drugstores or grocery stores and don't require a prescription. They are meant to be used as a back-up method with one of the other methods, such as a condom.Spermicides When Used AloneEffectivenessPerfect use: 82 %Typical use: 72 %How It WorksSpermicides work by killing sperm and keeping them from joining with an egg. They come in many types\u2014creams, films, foams, gels, and suppositories. A girl or woman lies down or squats, then gently inserts the spermicide deep into her vagina using her fingers or an applicator.Keep in MindFor most spermicides, a girl or woman will need to wait 10-15 minutes after inserting the spermicide before havingvaginal intercourse. This allows time for the spermicide to dissolve. Spermicide typically remains effective for only one hour after insertion, and more spermicide must be inserted each time a girl or woman has vaginal intercourse. Spermicides can also cause irritation. Some people are allergic to them. Spermicides do not provide protection against STDs.Keep in mind that 85 percent of sexually active,heterosexualcouples who do not use ANY method of birth control will become pregnant within a year. If you don't want to get pregnant, it's important to use birth control, correctly and consistently\u2014this means every time."], ["I've heard a lot of things about abortion, and I'm not sure if they are true or not.

What will happen when it's time to give birth?", "We're glad you are asking us, but be sure to also ask your doctor or clinician for some books onpregnancythat he or she recommends. It's important to see a doctor or clinician as soon as possible. Gettingprenatal careearly in a pregnancy is one of the best ways to prevent health problems for you and your baby. Teen mothers are more likely than older mothers to face health complications such as givingbirthprematurely and having babies who are very small. A lot of these complications come from having a poor diet, not beginning prenatal care early enough, not having regular checkups throughout the pregnancy or taking in substances such as alcohol or drugs.Yourgynecologistor the prenatal clinic can help you put together a healthy diet and exercise plan and talk with you about other considerations you need to pay careful attention to because you're pregnant. Your clinician can give you a list of things to avoid and can prescribe prenatal vitamins. If you see any other doctors for other health problems, make sure they know you're pregnant. Some prescription medications and medical procedures are harmful if you are pregnant.During the nine months of pregnancy, your body changes as thefetusgrows inside you.Check out the Mayo Clinic's site about what to expect throughout pregnancy.In the first weeks, you may feel few changes or you could feel really tired and nauseous. You might also notice that yourbreastsare swollen or sore. These symptoms are most common during the firsttrimester\u2014the first three months of pregnancy.During the second trimester, you'll start to gain more weight, but usually the fatigue and nausea go away. Because of that, many girls and women feel better during this part of the pregnancy. Others don't, and the fatigue and nausea continue throughout the pregnancy. You'll also notice a need to go to the bathroom more often.During the last trimester, especially the last few weeks, a lot of pregnant girls and women are uncomfortable, because they've gained much more weight and their expandeduterusputs pressure on other parts of their body, including their bladder, kidneys and lungs. Sometimes, they have trouble sleeping.Your body also starts preparing for the birth. Your muscles and ligaments will loosen up. You might feel off balance and like you're not in charge of your own body. You may also begin feeling contractions in your uterus. These are called \"Braxton-Hicks\" contractions that prepare the uterus for the work of pushing the baby out. They also help to slowly open yourcervix. A fetus typically turns itself around, so it's in an upside down position. Babies usuallycome outheadfirst, so the fetus turns to get in the \"birthing\" position. The fetus also usually drops (moves lower in the body) when it gets closer to delivery time.When you go into labor, these contractions will intensify and they'll start to hurt. Your water might break; this is when the sac that holds the amniotic fluid that has helped keep the fetus safe and growing the past nine months is done doing its job. Once this sac breaks, you will notice fluid or water released from thevagina. When your water breaks, delivery has to follow soon after, or else there is a risk of infection to both mother and baby.Giving birth is a natural process. Your body will do the work, without much help, in most cases. Bearing through the contractions is often the toughest part. Most hospitals offer birthing classes that you can take with the baby's father or another supportive person in your life. These classes explain the whole process and give you ways to cope with the pain. Be sure to talk to yourhealth care providerabout pain control options during delivery. One pain management option is called an \"epidural,\" which is an injection that basically numbs your pelvic area. Your doctor can talk to you about the pros and cons of this, as well as other types of pain management.Being in the delivery room to experience childbirth can also be an intense process for the baby's father or another person or people who are with you because they are important to you. Some young dads who have participated in the delivery say they experience intense connections and a sense of responsibility when they see and hold their newborn child for the first time. If the father and mother have a positive relationship, the mother may want to involve the father in the birth.These are just general guidelines. Everyone is different. Ask other people about their pregnancy or their partner's pregnancy. And again, be sure to ask your doctor or clinician, or check the local library for resources."], ["Am I too young to fall in love?

The capacity to love is something that all human beings, regardless of age, can experience.There are a lot of different kinds of love\u2014romantic, parental,platonic.

It has a ring on each end, one open and one closed, and is connected by a condom-shaped tube. The closed ring is inserted into the vagina and fits around thecervix, which is the opening of theuterus. The other ring stays just outside thevaginal opening. This is where thepenisis inserted duringvaginal intercourse.To insert this condom anally, someone would remove the closed ring from the condom, place the condom over the erect penis and insert the penis inside the anus during anal sex. The other ring stays just outside the anal opening.Female condoms can only be used once. Never use a female condom andmale condomtogether. They could rub together and rip, and you'll end up with no protection.When used perfectly, a female condom prevents pregnancy about 95 percent of the time. The typical use rate is a lot lower\u201479 percent\u2014because people don't always use them correctly.Just like condoms, female condoms only prevent the transmission of STDs that are passed through body fluids\u2014HIV,gonorrhea,chlamydiaandsyphilis. Some STDs, likeherpesandHPV, are spread through skin-to-skin contact. A female condom may not cover areas of the skin that are infected, such as thescrotum,labiaor even the inside of the thigh. So condoms \u2013both male and female\u2014may not protect against these kinds of infections.The good news is that there are few side effects from female condoms. Some say they slip or are uncomfortable during sex, especially if the rings rub or pull against the penis or the vagina. Some, though, say the female condom stimulates theclitoris, which can increase pleasure during intercourse.Female condoms are sold in drugstores and supermarkets without a prescription. They cost about three dollars each."], ["What happens during menstruation (a period) and does it hurt? What products should I use during my period?", "The development of amenstrual cycleis part ofpubertyfor girls. This cycle prepares a girl's body forpregnancyeach month; if no pregnancy occurs during that cycle, hormones signal to the body to end the cycle. When the cycle ends, blood and other nutrients that have lined theuterusare released from thevaginal opening. This is called amenstruationor a period.For each menstrual cycle (which lasts about 28 days but can vary widely), an egg (ovum) matures and is released from one of a girl's two ovaries. The egg travels from theovary, through afallopian tube(there is one for each ovary) toward the uterus. As the egg travels, it sends hormonal signals to the body, telling it to develop a thick lining of blood and tissue inside the uterus. The job of this lining is to help the egg attach to the uterus, should it meet up with aspermand become fertilized. If this happens, the fertilized egg latches onto the thick lining of tissue and blood, and a pregnancy begins.While a cycle can last about 28 days, each girl's cycle is different. A girl's period can come anywhere from every 21 days to every 34 days. When a girl first starts getting her period, it might skip a month or she may have a period earlier or later than she thought it would come. This is a normal part of growing into anadult. Eventually, a girl's cycle will stabilize, and it will be easier to know when to expect a period, though some girls are have irregular periods\u2014when their cycle can be a different number of days each month\u2014their whole lives.During the menstrual cycle, the uterus contracts to help push the blood and tissue from the body. These contractions can cause menstrual cramps a girl might feel during her period. They can be uncomfortable, but they don't happen for everyone. Cramps can be eased by taking over-the-counter medications, like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, which are available in drugstores and supermarkets. Stretching, sitting in a warm bath or using a heating pad on the abdomen or lower back can also help ease menstrual cramps. Exercise and eating healthy, especially before the period starts, can also help. It's uncommon for cramps to be so bad that a girl has to spend the day in bed, but if that were to happen, she could visit a doctor to find out what's going on.PMSSome girls feel cranky, tired, moody, bloated, achy and irritable the week before their period begins. This is calledpremenstrual syndrome (PMS). This happens becausehormonechanges in the body can affect all sorts of things, including mood, water retention and the sleep cycle. Some girls have little to no PMS. Others have a tough time functioning when it happens. If your PMS is very bad, talk to yourhealth care providerabout how you can manage it.Sanitary Pads and TamponsThe most common menstrual products are sanitary pads or tampons, which are both available in drugstores and supermarkets.Pads come in a lot of different shapes and sizes\u2014maxi pads for heavy days, thin pads for light ones, pads for overnight and pads that are longer.

The other side is an absorbent material, sometimes covered by a thin mesh to help keep your skin dry.Tampons also come in various sizes\u2014like regular or super\u2014and are designed for different flows. They're inserted into thevaginaand can be a good choice if you're going swimming, have a longer period of time where you can't use a bathroom or just don't want to wear a pad.Tampons must be changed every four to six hours to prevent the possibility of an illness called toxic shock syndrome (TSS). Wearing tampons (especially wearing the super absorbent kind when your flow is normal) for a long time can trapbacteriainside your vagina and can cause TSS. TSS symptoms include fever, nausea, vomiting, severe diarrhea, headache, dizziness, sore throat and a rash or peeling skin on your hands and feet. TSS is rare and can be treated withantibioticsif caught early enough.Menstrual Cups and SpongesMenstrual cups are inserted into the vagina and cover thecervix(the bottom end of the uterus). Menstrual blood collects in the cup, which can be worn up to 12 hours. When the cup needs to be changed, it's removed, washed and reinserted or replaced with a new one. Menstrual cups are sold under a variety of brand names, including Instead, the Diva Cup or The Keeper.Menstrual sponges or seaspongetampons are made of natural sea sponge and are also inserted into the vagina, covering the cervix. Because they're sponges, they're very absorbent and can be changed less often than atamponor pad. They can even be cleaned and re-inserted.Menstrual cups and sponges are much less commonly used than other methods and may take a little practice, just like any other method that's new to someone. Menstrual cups and sponges are also considered more environmentally friendly because they can be reused so there's no waste.Scented Menstrual Products andDouchingIt's a good idea to avoid scented menstrual products because they can irritate the vagina and just aren't necessary. It's also good to avoid douching, vaginal powders and sprays (both during your period and afterward) because they can also irritate the vagina.

The sooner a girl takes EC, the better. It can reduce the chance of a pregnancy by up to 89 percent.Emergencycontraception(EC) is basically a high dose of certain types ofbirth control pills.

When a guy and a girl have unprotectedvaginal sex, semen is deposited into thevagina. The sperm swim through thecervixanduterusinto the fallopian tubes. If the girl has recently ovulated (released an egg from one of her two ovaries), then the sperm can join with the egg. When the sperm and egg join, it is called fertilization.Pregnancy can also happen byalternative fertilization, where ahealth care providerinserts semen into the vagina through a process called in vitro fertilization (IVF).Girls usually release an egg about once a month through a process calledovulation. An egg can be fertilized for 24 to 36 hours. Sperm, on the other hand, can live for five to seven days inside the female reproductive system. That means a couple can have intercourse on Saturday, the female could ovulate on Wednesday, and the sperm could fertilize the egg on Thursday.Once the sperm fertilizes the egg, a zygote is formed. This is a cluster of cells that continues to divide as it travels along thefallopian tube. After five days, it is referred to as a blastocyst. When it reaches the uterus, there is a lining of blood and other tissue in the uterus that has been developing in case an egg is fertilized. The blastocyst attaches to this nutrient-rich lining and literally dumps its genetic material into the lining. This process is called implantation. Once that happens, she is medically pregnant. After implantation, the mass of cells is referred to as an embryo, and later, after a couple of weeks, it is referred to as afetus.If sperm are deposited into a girl's reproductive system but no egg is present, or if an egg is present but sperm don't fertilize it (sometimes this happens), then the egg dies and the lining of the uterus sheds. A girl getting a period is the shedding of this lining."], ["People talk about good communication in relationships, but what does that mean?", "Communication is an important part of a healthy relationship.

These feelings can help you learn about yourself and what you're looking for in a partner, without getting into a situation that you're not ready for.There can be a big difference in maturity levels and life experience between two people, especially when there is a big difference in age. Because of this, it can get tricky when a teen wants to become involved with someone who is much older than he or she is. Without realizing it, there is an imbalance of power in the relationship.Because older partners tend to have more experience, and possibly more freedom, this can give them an unfair advantage over younger teens that have less experience and freedom. This can affect things like where you hang out, who drives and what you do sexually. It can also place pressure on the younger partner to try things they're not ready for, simply because the older partner makes it seem like it's no big deal.Problems also crop up if the older person\u2014who can be male or female\u2014stops you from hanging out with friends your own age or doing things at school.

If used perfectly, they prevent pregnancy about 91 to 94 percent of the time.In general, the diaphragm is wider and provides a looser fit. The cervical cap provides a much tighter fit because it creates a suction seal around the cervix. Both come in different sizes because the size of a cervix differs for each woman. To get either, a girl needs to be fitted by a doctor or otherhealth care provider. A prescription is also required for both methods. Cost varies depending on where it is fitted and purchased.To use a diaphragm or cervical cap, a girl puts spermicidal gel into the cup and around the edge and then inserts the diaphragm or cervical cap into the vagina before intercourse. The spermicidal gel provides a tight, sperm-killing barrier around the diaphragm or cervical cap. A diaphragm or cervical cap must be left in place for six to eight hours after intercourse. Having the diaphragm in for longer than 24 hours is not recommended, whereas the cervical cap can stay in for up to 48 hours before it is removed and cleaned.In the case of the diaphragm or the cervical cap, girls can get irritation just from having the cap or diaphragm inside them or they may experience pressure against their bladder.

Abusers can often be very charming in the beginning. That's why many people get trapped in abusive relationships. They don't see it coming, and by the time they recognize the abuse, they feel like they've caused it or can't get out of it. Abusers usually blame their partners for the abuse. They might say things like, \"I can't believe you made me hit you.\" That's how abusers keep their partners afraid and dependent.Here are some questions to ask yourself if you think you might be in an abusive relationship:Does your partner\u2026Constantly criticize you, your intelligence and/or your self-worth?Act jealous, especially when other people try to talk to you or spend time with you?Make threats against you or someone you care about?Try to keep you from having any friends, especially friends they might see as potential romantic competition?Have problems controlling their temper\u2014even if it's not directed at you?Insist that you do something sexual that you don't want to do, even when you have told them you don't want to?Often, abusive people justify their behavior asloveor flattery, at least in the beginning. Think about it. Your partner gets a little jealous when someone else flirts with you. That can feel flattering for some people. Abusive people can also be very subtle when they isolate their partner from friends and family. You might not even notice it's happening. They just say things like, \"Let's go do something, just the two of us,\" or, \"I just want to spend time with you.\" Again, some of this can be normal, but it can also be a sign of abuse when it happens a lot. You may start to notice that your friends have slipped out of the picture. And then when the trouble begins or gets worse, there's no one there to turn to for help or support. The abusive person has isolated you and made you more dependent. That's the whole idea behind an abusive relationship.

The virus comes in two strains (types) and causes small, painful sores on thegenitals(HSV-2) or on or around the mouth (HSV-1). Even though one type is more common on the genitals and one is more common on or around the mouth, both types of herpes can be spread from genitals to genitals, mouth to mouth, mouth to genitals and genitals to mouth.A person can be infected with herpes and not have any symptoms. Or they may have mild symptoms that are mistaken for something else. When someone does have typical symptoms, they begin as blisters that then become sores, which are usually oozing and painful. These sores can appear anywhere around the mouth in the form of cold sores or fever blisters, or on the genitals oranus. During the first \"outbreak\" of sores, the sores typically dry up and heal in about two weeks. Later on, outbreaks are generally shorter and milder. A person may feel a tingling sensation around the area of the skin right before sores appear and may have a low-grade fever.A person is most contagious when the sores are visible, but the virus can also spread from the skin even when there are no sores on the mouth or genitals. Someone who experiences an outbreak of cold sores should not haveoralsex, kiss or share drinking glasses or lip balm during the outbreak to prevent transmitting the virus to someone else. Condoms and othersafer sexmethods can be somewhat effective during a herpes outbreak, but may not cover the area of skin where sores are (or were) present.Because it is possible to transmit herpes from the mouth to the genitals or the genitals to the mouth, using acondomordental damfor oral sex is important. Herpes is also the onlySTDthat can be transmitted through kissing, though it isfareasier to pass oral herpes when one kissing partner has an outbreak than when one doesn't.The herpes virus stays in a person's body their whole life, and outbreaks of sores can happen throughout life. Sometimes after a while, a person will get fewer outbreaks than they used to get or will stop getting outbreaks, but the virus is still in his or her body and can still be passed to another person. It is also important to remember that some people don't experience any symptoms or sores yet they are still infected. There's no cure for herpes, but there are medicines that can help reduce the pain, control the number of outbreaks, shorten the length of outbreaks and lower the risk of passing herpes to a sexual partner. A doctor or otherhealth care providercan prescribe the medicine.For more information on herpes testing, treatment and support, Visit theAmerican Sexual Health Association's website or visitI Wanna Know."], ["Does the Pill make you gain weight?", "No. This is a very popular myth that evensexualityeducators and doctors repeat. A recent study,\"Combination Contraceptives: Effects on Weight,\" debunked this myth by analyzing data from 44 studies from around the world, dating from 1970 to 2005.This myth probably has stuck because people of all ages tend to gain weight over time, whether they are usingbirth controlor not. So, when women or girls are taking the Pill and they gain weight, guess who gets the blame? The Pill.People tend to blame outside factors for their weight gain, not their own eating or exercise habits.

It also must be used consistently\u2014meaning, each and every time a person has vaginal, oral or analsex\u2014and correctly.\"Correctly\" means following the steps below, each and every time. When a condom breaks, it's usually because one of these steps wasn't followed. Luckily, condoms come with instructions, so you can read them there instead of checking online! There are also several good demonstration videos online to help you. The directions should cover these same steps:Check theexpiration date. This should be clearly printed on theboxand on the condom wrapper. If the condoms have expired, even by only a few days, do not use them. The material that they are made of and the lubricants they might have on them can break down over time, which means they're more likely to break if they're past expiration.When you store a condom to use it later, keep it in a cool, dry place, so as not to damage it. In practical terms, this means that you shouldn't keep condoms in your pocket or wallet for a long time. Leaving them in a car for a long period of time is also a bad idea.When you are in a situation where you are about to have anal orvaginal sex, open thepackagecarefully (don't use your fingernails\u2014and don't use your teeth!), and remove the condom from the wrapper.Condoms are rolled up when theycome outof the package. Therefore, you need to figure out which is the inside and which is the outside of the condom. How do you tell? Hold the condom so it looks like a hat, with the thick, rolled-up part on the outside. As you look at it, you'll be able to see how you would roll it easily over an erectpenis.Pinch the tip of the condom to squeeze the air out of the condom. This will allowsemento collect in the tip at the top. The condom could break if the tip is not squeezed and air bubbles are let in, so keep pinching it the whole time.Keep pinching the tip as you place the condom on theheadof the erect penis.Keep pinching the tip with one hand as you roll the condom all the way down to the base of the penis with the other hand.Afterejaculation(which doesn't always happen) grasp the condom at the base of the penis and remove the penis (with the condom still on it) from your partner's body.Turn away from your partner'svaginaoranusand carefully remove the condom from the penis. You can tie a knot at the end once it's off so no semen dumps out.Wrap the condom in a tissue and throw it away. Do not flush it down the toilet.NEVER reuse a condom.To practice saferoral sex, you can use a flavored latex condom. There are many varieties of flavored condoms. For oral sex on a penis, follow the instructions above. When ejaculation happens, remove the penis from your partner's mouth, then remove and discard the condom in the same way as described above.For oral sex on avulvaor anus, cut off the elastic ring at the base of the condom, then cut the condom open with scissors. The condom will now look more like a sheet of latex. Place it on your partner's vulva or anus with the flavored side up. There are also latex sheets available, called \"latex dams\" or \"dental dams,\" which can also be used for oral sex on a partner.When used correctly and consistently, condoms are highly effective at preventingHIVandpregnancyand also very effective at preventing other STDs.

The majority of people will produce enough antibodies by eight weeks, but in rare cases it can take up to six months. If someone gets tested too early, they might not realize that HIV is present in their blood and they are still able to pass the virus to others.Testing for HIV is done either with blood test or a swab of cells from inside the mouth. HIV testing can be done anonymously (meaning you don't give your name or any information that could be used to identify you) or confidentially (meaning test results are private and can't be released to anyone else).You can get tested for HIV through your private doctor, aclinicor by buying anHIV test kitthrough the Internet.\u00a0However, we highly recommend seeing ahealth care provider, whether at a doctor's office or a clinic, for HIV testing.

Some of these bacteria are \"good\" bacteria, which keep the vagina clean and healthy, and some are \"bad\" and can cause infections such as BV.

Hormones (estrogenandprogesterone), which are concentrated in the Ring, are released into the reproductive system to prevent the body from releasing eggs (ovulating).A girl inserts the Ring into the vagina between the first and fifth day of hermenstrual cycle. The Ring stays in the vagina for exactly three weeks, and then the girl removes it. Two to three days after it's removed, bleeding that's like a period will occur. Exactly seven days from when she removes the ring, she inserts a new one. This gives ongoing protection against pregnancy.The NuvaRing prevents pregnancy 99 percent of the time when used correctly every single month. It's fully effective seven days after it is first inserted into the vagina and then continuously after that. The NuvaRing does not protect against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), so backup method ofbirth control, such as a male andfemale condom, should be used. Some side effects include vaginal infections, irritation and discharge, headaches, weight gain or loss and nausea.A prescription is needed for the Ring, just like any otherhormonal methodofbirthcontrol.

People who are bisexual people can feel attracted to people of more than one gender.The term queer can sometimes apply to someone who is lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. Some people call themselves queer, but not everyone feels comfortable with that term because it has sometimes been used as an insult against LGBTQ people.Transgender is different from lesbian, gay and bisexual. Though these terms are often grouped together under LGBTQ, transgender is actually agender identity, not a sexual orientation.Gender identity is our innermost sense of whether we feel like we're a guy, a girl or someone else altogether. Our feelings about our gender identity often match up with the bodies we have. Someone who has apenisand testicles may close his eyes and think, \"Yep, I'm a guy!\" and someone who has avaginaand ovaries may close her eyes and think, \"Yep, I'm a girl!\" But sometimes our feelings and our bodies don't match.

Talking about protection before sexual behavior becomes part of your relationship can give you an opportunity to get closer to your partner emotionally and can help the two of you decide whether you're on the same page when it comes to expectations about sex and protection. Unfortunately, many people find themselves trying to convince a partner to use acondomat the moment when they are feeling turned on, emotionally or physically vulnerable or even drunk.If you take the time beforehand to have this important conversation, then you can anticipate any potential problems and take steps to avoid situations where it will be hard to get what you need.

They might also do a blood test forHIV,syphilisor hepatitis or they may do a mouth swab test for HIV.You should ask a clinic or doctor's office which STDs they test for. Some clinics routinely test for only a few infections, so if there is a particular test you need, ask for it. Also, don't assume thatSTDtests are part of a routine physical orpelvic exam. Some STD tests require writtenconsent, so be sure you know if you're being tested and for what.Since many STDs have no symptoms, you can't rely on symptoms alone. The longer an STD goes untreated, the more damage it can do to you and others. STDs need to be treated because they won't go away on their own. For example, you may not have any symptoms thatgonorrhea, but you can still pass the STD on to someone else if you're not treated.When you can get tested really depends on the STD. Some, like gonorrhea andchlamydia, can be detected in the body soon after you have been infected, even if you have no symptoms. STDs, such asHPVandherpes, can sometimes be detected in the blood before they show up on the skin, but those tests do not always pick up the infection before visible symptoms occur. Other STDs, like HIV, require a waiting period so that enough of thevirus,bacteriaor antibodies are present and detected on the test. Antibodies are created when you get a particular infection and your body tries to fight it. In the case of HIV, it can take up to three months for enough antibodies to be produced in the blood to cause a positiveHIV testresult.When you go to get tested, you will need to be prepared to share personal information with ahealth care provider. The provider will ask you about the types of sexual behaviors you did, the number of partners you had and when you\u00a0last might have been at risk for getting an STD. Health care providers are not there to judge you, so it's important for you to be honest.

Puberty is the process that changes the body from that of a child to that of anadult.On the outside of the body, \"breast budding\" is usually the first sign that girls have entered puberty. It can be scary and exciting all at the same time. Girls notice slight changes in the size and shape of theirbreastsas they begin to grow. Girls might also noticeacne, body odor, sweat and hair growing in the armpits and around thevulva. Hair on the legs will become more evident. Girls may also grow wider hips and larger breasts, although the size and shape of both of these body parts will be different on different girls. All of these changes are the result of hormones\u2014chemicals in the body.Mood swings can also be a part of puberty. A girl might feel happy one second, sad and angry the next\u2014without being sure why she's feeling that way. This can seem like a roller coaster ride because a girl feels like she has no control. The good news is that these mood swings are part of the process, and both boys and girls go through them. If you know what to expect, sometimes it's easier to deal with them when they happen.Inside a girl's body, heruterus,cervixand ovaries are growing and maturing too. Sometime in the middle of puberty, girls usually get their first menstrual period.GuysWhen a guy starts going through puberty, the first thing that happens is growth of the testicles. In general, all of the other changes happen as a result of the increasedtestosterone, ahormoneproduced by the testicles.The first thing a guy usually notices is hair growing under his arms, around hispenisarea (genitals) and on his face. Hair on other parts of his body will often get thicker and darker too. Some guys have more hair than others. Genetics play a part in this. That means if your biological dad, for example, has a lot of body hair, you might have a lot of body hair, too. Guys may also notice acne, body odor or increased sweating. Like girls, guys will notice changes in mood. This is due to the changing hormone levels that take place during puberty.Also during puberty, a guy's voiceboxgrows. That's what causes his voice to crack and squeak. It takes a little time for the cracking to stop, as the voice deepens and settles into its adult tone. The penis, testicles andscrotumalso grow during puberty. The testicles will also start to producesperm. Since your testicles are growing faster than your penis at first, it might seem like your penis is shrinking. It's not.During puberty, it's also common for boys to have large growth spurts, times when they grow fast over a short period of time. This rapid growth can cause \"growing pains,\" when joints and muscles ache and get sore. When a guy grows very fast, he doesn't have time to get used to his larger limbs, so he sometimes feels awkward and clumsy.Another thing that can happen to guys during puberty is getting anerectionout of nowhere. It is perfectly normal for teen guys to get erections when they don't even feel turned on. They can happen without warning and at embarrassing times.

Is it the same as the G-spot?", "Theclitorisis a small, sensitive organ located at the top of thevulva, just above theurethraand thevaginal opening. The function of the clitoris is to provide pleasure. Many women and girls enjoy touching, or having their partners touch their clitoris because this can be arousing and can also give them anorgasm.TheG-spotis inside thevagina, on the front wall toward the front of the body and has a different texture than other areas inside the vagina. Some girls and women say that rubbing this spot gives them an orgasm. These orgasms sometimes result inejaculation. That is, some girls spray a fluid out of the area near the urethra\u2014noturine\u2014during orgasm.Finding the G-spot can be tricky. When a finger is inserted into the vagina, think of the opening as a clock. Pressing toward the front side of the body, toward the pelvic bone, is 12:00 and pressing down toward theanusis 6:00. The G-spot on most females is at 12:00. It is only about an inch or two inside the entrance to the vagina, and the skin feels uneven. The tissue usually swells a little during intense stimulation.Since each person likes to be touched differently, talk with your partner about what exactly feels good, such as the place being touched and the amount of pressure used. Most people would agree that communication is key to the healthiest sexual experiences.By the way, males have a \"male G-spot\": theprostategland."], ["I told my partner that I have a sexually transmitted disease (STD) and they broke up with me.

You should be proud of yourself for that.Unfortunately, no matter how honest you are about telling people about your STD status, you cannot control how they will react. The good thing is that just as there are experiences like the one you just had, there are good ones too. There are people who will be willing to learn about your particular STD, talk to you about it and do what they can to protect themselves.You can also check out theAmerican Sexual Health Association website. They have a lot of resources for people living with STDs, including advice about telling partners, protecting partners from being infected and information about local support groups."], ["What are spermicides?", "Spermicideis a chemical that killssperm; this prevents fertilization of an egg. Spermicide comes on some condoms (be sure to check thepackage), but it is also marketed in forms that are inserted into thevagina. These include suppositories, foams, creams, inserts, film and gels. People can use a spermicide alone, but it's more effective at preventingpregnancywhen used with acondom,diaphragmorcervical cap.To use spermicides in the vagina, there is a slight waiting period before they are effective. Usually this time period is between 10 and 15 minutes. This allows time for body heat to melt the spermicide so it effectively covers thecervix.When used alone and perfectly (every time you engage invaginal sex), spermicides prevent pregnancy about 82 percent of the time. With more typical use, they prevent pregnancy about 72 percent of the time. Condoms improve the chance of preventing pregnancy and the transmission of STDs.Some people can be allergic to the chemicals used in spermicides. Soreness, itching, redness and swelling are the most common allergy symptoms. If someone has a reaction to the spermicides and has unprotectedsexwith a partner, then the rubbing against the irritated skin can make them more susceptible to contracting a sexually transmitted disease (STD), if their partner has one. This is another reason why using condoms along with spermicides is a good idea.Spermicides are sold in many drugstores and pharmacies, as well as in family planning clinics. One tube of gel or cream typically costs about eight dollars. One dose of an insert, film or foam typically costs about a dollar and is sold in packs of three, six or more.For more information and photos of all thebirth controlmethods, check outthis FAQ."], ["I'm pregnant and considering having an abortion.

Abuse happens over time, usually in a cycle. It often continues until the person who is being abused gets help. Sometimes, someone else\u2014a friend, family member\u2014recognizes the abuse and jumps in to help.Many times, abuse can be hard to recognize and understand. One of the reasons is that an abusive person may not alwaysseemabusive. An abusive person might seem like a nice person a lot of the time, and they might say that they care or are inlove. Abuse rarely stops all by itself, but there are ways to gethelpif you think you are being abused.Different Types of AbusePhysical abuseis when someone physically hurts another person. Hitting, slapping, punching, kicking, burning, hair-pulling, choking and cutting are some examples of physical abuse. Physical abuse can leave bruises, burns and other physical marks. A lot of times, someone who is being physically abused will hide their wounds with clothes, sunglasses, make up or in other ways.Emotional abuseis when someone uses insults, criticisms and other hurtful words that make a person feel bad. People who are being emotionally abused might hear that they're fat, ugly, stupid or worthless or will never amount to anything. Emotional abuse can be done in private, but it can also be done in front of other people.Psychological abuseis the use of threats or other behaviors to scare someone and reduce their support system\u2014the people and resources someone relies on for help and support. People who psychologically abuse others do so in an attempt to make a person lose touch with reality so the person becomes dependent on the abuser. The abuser might threaten to punish or harm the person, someone they care about or themselves in order to get them to do what they want. Other examples of psychological abuse are stalking or preventing a person from sleeping.Sexual abuseis forcing someone to do something sexual against their will.Sexual abuseincludes a lot of sexual behaviors\u2014everything from fondling a person'sgenitalsand havingsexual intercourseto forcing someone to watch porn or perform sex acts for money.Rapeandincestare forms of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse can happen to both guys and girls.Financial abuseis when someone uses money to control another person. If one person has more money than the other person in a relationship, he or she may withhold money or control what that money can buy in order to control their partner. For teens, it might be that one of the partners has a job and because they always pay for everything, the partner with money uses that power to pressure the other person into things likesex.In the cycle of abuse, there can be a build-up of tension or stress before some kind of abusive incident happens. After the build-up, usually the abusive person does something abusive, whether it's physical, emotional, sexual or another type of abuse. Then it gets a little more confusing because there's usually a period of calm after the abuse. The abuser might apologize, swear it will never happen again or say that he or she will change. The abuser might bring the person who is being abused presents or be really nice to make up for the abuse. But usually the cycle just starts over again, and there will be more tension and more abuse.Exposure to any kind of abuse for a long time can damage a person's physical and emotional health. According to theNational Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the majority of people who have experienced abuse from a partner are females, most frequently with males doing the abusing. But abuse can happen to people of all sexes. Abuse also happens in all types of relationships\u2014between partners of all sexes as well as between spouses, parent(s) and child(ren), and friends. Abuse can happen to people with little money and to people with lots of money. Abusive people can have\u00a0college degrees or very little education. The same goes for people who are abused.

It is easier to see on guys because the opening is visible at the end of thepenis. A girl's urethra is usually hidden from view by herlabia(vaginal lips).For guys, the urethra runs inside of the penis to the outside of the body and allows semen and urine to leave the body. When a guy gets anerection, a gland releases a clear fluid that comes out of the tip of the penis. At the same time, a valve shuts off the passageway between the bladder, where urine is stored, and the urethra. This makes it impossible for a guy to urinate andejaculateat the same time.The clear fluid that comes out is called pre-ejaculatory fluid orpre-cum. This fluid cleans out the inside of the urethra. It makes the urethra less acidic and gives thesperma better shot at surviving the trip from the testicles to the fallopian tubes (if the guy is havingsexwith a girl). Pre-ejaculatory fluid may contain sperm in some guys and it can carry sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in all, so a guy who's about to have intercourse should put on acondomas soon as he gets an erection."], ["What happens the morning after?

About 20 million Americans are currently living with HPV, and there are an estimated six million new cases every year. There are about 100 different strains (kinds or types) of HPV and over 40 of those can infect someone's genital areas. HPV is usually passed by close skin-to-skin sexual contact (including oral, anal orvaginal sex) between someone with the infection and their sexual partner.Different strains of HPV affect the body differently; some strains can be cleared from the body over time with no negative effects and no treatment. Others cause visiblegenital wartsor an increased risk for cancer of thecervix,penis,anus,vulva,vaginaand/or throat. The types of HPV that cause genital warts are not the same as the types that can cause cancer.In the U.S., there are two vaccines,GardasilandCervarix, which have been approved and offer protection against HPV for both guys and girls. Gardasil has been shown to protect females from the four types of HPV that cause most cases ofcervical cancerand genital warts. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared Gardasil to be given to boys ages 9 to 26 as well as girls these ages. Cervarix is approved only for females and targets the two strains of HPV that are the leading causes of cervical cancer.There are many types of HPV. Some cause genital warts, but only ahealth care providercan diagnose HPV. APap testcan be used to diagnose irregular\u00a0cells on the cervix or in the rectum caused by HPV.\u00a0Talk with your health care provider about whether you might benefit from a cervical or anal Pap.Once a health care provider makes a diagnosis for HPV, he or she will talk with you about the specific options that are available to you. Treatments are available to help people manage their HPV symptoms, but because it is a virus, it may remain in someone's body for life.HPV is\u00a0spread through certain sexual behaviors. If you choose to be sexually active, the best way to minimize your risk is to use condoms and safersexmethods during all types of sexual touching. Keep in mind that condoms may not cover all areas of the genital skin where the virus is present. Also, the more sexual partners you have, and the more partners they've had, the greater your risk of getting infected.For more information, visit theAmerican Sexual Health Association's website."], ["I'm female, and sex is painful for me.

You can buy water-based lubricants at the store. Don't use petroleum jelly, types of massage oils, baby oil or lotion because oil-based products or products with oils in them cause latex to disintegrate and at the very least may weaken the condom, causing it to break.Another reason intercourse may be painful is if you are tense or worried.
