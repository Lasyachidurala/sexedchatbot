module.exports = {"Comprehensive Sex Education": "A form of education that encourages a positive view of sexuality as a natural part of human development. It provides information about sexual abstinence as well as pregnancy and disease prevention, and provides teens with skills to ensure they are able to take care of their sexual health by making healthy, responsible decisions.", "I think I might have a sexually transmitted disease (STD). How do I find out for sure, and how do I tell my partner?": "If you had vaginal, oral or anal sex and didn't use a new latex, polyisoprene, nitrile or polyurethane condom or dental dam with each act, you could have been exposed to an STD. There's one way of knowing for sure whether you have an STD: get tested. Check out this page to find a clinic near you. And find out how to talk to your partner. If you do end up testing positive for an STD, know that you are not alone. It can be helpful to get more information about it so you can know the facts before you talk to anyone else about it. Your doctor, another health care provider or the person that tested you can often be a good person to talk to about any questions you have. Sometimes people need time to get used to the news themselves before they feel comfortable talking about it with another person. &nbsp;", "Areola": "An area of skin around the nipples (of guys and girls) that is darker than the rest of the breast.", "Perineum": "The area of tissue between the vaginal opening or the scrotum and the anus. The slang term for this is taint.", "NuvaRing": "A form of hormonal birth control. The NuvaRing is a soft, flexible and transparent ring that prevents pregnancy when inserted into the vagina, up near the cervix. It releases a combination of hormones, and is 98-percent effective at preventing pregnancy with perfect use. NuvaRing is worn inside the vagina for three weeks and then removed at the beginning of the fourth week, then a new one is inserted a week later. It must be prescribed by a health care provider. It does not protect against sexually transmitted diseases. To learn more, visit the NuvaRing website.", "Snatch": "A slang term for a vulva.", "What are spermicides?": "Spermicide is a chemical that kills sperm ; this prevents fertilization of an egg. Spermicide comes on some condoms (be sure to check the package ), but it is also marketed in forms that are inserted into the vagina. These include suppositories, foams, creams, inserts, film and gels. People can use a spermicide alone, but it's more effective at preventing pregnancy when used with a condom, diaphragm or cervical cap. To use spermicides in the vagina, there is a slight waiting period before they are effective. Usually this time period is between 10 and 15 minutes. This allows time for body heat to melt the spermicide so it effectively covers the cervix. When used alone and perfectly (every time you engage in vaginal sex ), spermicides prevent pregnancy about 82 percent of the time. With more typical use, they prevent pregnancy about 72 percent of the time. Condoms improve the chance of preventing pregnancy and the transmission of STDs. Some people can be allergic to the chemicals used in spermicides. Soreness, itching, redness and swelling are the most common allergy symptoms. If someone has a reaction to the spermicides and has unprotected sex with a partner, then the rubbing against the irritated skin can make them more susceptible to contracting a sexually transmitted disease ( STD ), if their partner has one. This is another reason why using condoms along with spermicides is a good idea. Spermicides are sold in many drugstores and pharmacies, as well as in family planning clinics. One tube of gel or cream typically costs about eight dollars. One dose of an insert, film or foam typically costs about a dollar and is sold in packs of three, six or more.

Often, people hear the words \" rape \" or \" sexual assault \" and automatically figure the victim is female. This isn't always true. Males can be raped. Also, females can rape people. Regardless of how rape is defined legally, being forced to do something sexually that you did not agree to is always wrong and can have lasting effects, regardless of your sex or the sex of the person who raped you. A guy can be penetrated by a penis or object, anally, for example. And despite what some people think, a guy can also be forced to have vaginal intercourse. Just because a guy has an erection doesn't necessarily mean that he wants sex. An erection is simply a response to stimulation\u2014a normal, involuntary reaction that the body has\u2014and it sometimes can happen out of fear, shock or for no clear reason at all. It's hard for anyone to report rape or sexual assault. A guy might feel like he's not a \"real man\" if he was raped, or he may feel like no one would believe him because he's been taught that guys should always want and have sex if the situation arises. If the person who rapes him was a male, he might worry the rape \"made him gay.\" Or he may worry that others will think he's gay. If a gay or bisexual guy is raped by another guy, people sometimes think that he was \"asking for it\" or that he's making it up. These are all examples of myths that are out there that can make it even more difficult for guys who have been raped to get help. Just like anyone who has experienced rape, guys have nothing to feel guilty about or ashamed of if they are raped. It's not their fault. Someone guilty of rape\u2014whether they are male or female\u2014has hurt another person physically and psychologically and broken a law. Someone who has been raped has the right to heal physically and emotionally. There are many resources online for male rape survivors. One place to start is Male Survivor. Guys can also call the National Sexual Assault Hotline managed by the Rape Abuse and Incest National Network at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673). The hotline is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to provide support and information to all survivors of rape and sexual assault.", "Minor": "A person who is not old enough to be an adult under state law. The age varies by state. In most states, you are a minor if you are 17 years or younger. That means that in most states you are an adult if you are 18 or older.", "Surgical Abortion": "A procedure done to end a pregnancy that is performed by a doctor or clinician in a clinic setting under local or general anesthesia. During this procedure, a woman's cervix is dilated (widened) so that a vacuum-like tube or a curette (a spoon-like object) can be inserted and the contents of the uterus can be withdrawn. The procedure takes between five and 15 minutes. It is 99-percent effective.", "Analingus": "A sexual behavior where a person's mouth and/or tongue is used to stimulate a partner's anus. This is also known as rimming.", "I'm so confused about virginity. Is there a real definition?": "There really isn't one definition of virginity, or at least not one that everyone agrees with. Some people believe intercourse is when a penis goes inside a vagina and that this is the only way people lose their virginity. But this is a pretty limited definition, and it doesn't include people who have sex with someone of the same sex; it also doesn't include other sexual behaviors. Some people think that if you have oral or anal sex, then you've lost your virginity. Still others believe that a \"true\" loss of virginity only happens when at least one person has an orgasm. So, guess what? Defining \"virginity\" and giving it one label isn't as important as other things, like making sure you feel good about any sexual activity you decide to do and making sure you're protected from sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) or unplanned pregnancy. The important thing is to stay true to yourself. That means taking your time to make decisions about sex that are best for you\u2014not anyone else. Base these decisions on your own beliefs, values and feelings. If there are sexual things you don't want to do until you're older, or when you're in a certain kind of relationship, or when you're partnered with someone for life, those can help you determine how you define virginity. Secondary Virginity Sometimes after a person has sex, whether it's vaginal, oral or anal, they decide that it was a bad decision and they don't want to do it again. Some people refer to this decision not to have sex again as having \"secondary virginity.\" In other cases, a person\u2014guy or girl\u2014might have been raped or abused. Since they didn't consent to that behavior, it doesn't really count, and they consider themselves virgins until they make the choice to have sex with someone. This works for a lot of people. And that's good. But it's also important to count any sexual experiences you've had (consenting or not) as part of your sexual history when you visit a health care provider. Your risk of exposure to STDs depends on whether you've had sex. If you have been exposed to STDs, then you need to protect yourself and any future partners from infection by getting tested. Most clinics and hospitals offer free or low-cost STD testing and free information on sexual health. Find a clinic near you or locate a Planned Parenthood near you at 1-800-230-PLAN (7526).", "Slut": "A derogatory word for a girl who has had or is perceived to have had many sexual partners.", "When can I get tested for HIV?": "People who've been exposed to HIV through unprotected oral, anal or vaginal sex or sharing needles need to wait eight weeks to six months after exposure before they can take an HIV test. This period of time is called a \"window period.\" This time is necessary because the test looks for the body's reaction to the virus (antibodies) rather than for the virus itself and that reaction doesn't show up right away\u2014it can take months. The majority of people will produce enough antibodies by eight weeks, but in rare cases it can take up to six months. If someone gets tested too early, they might not realize that HIV is present in their blood and they are still able to pass the virus to others. Testing for HIV is done either with blood test or a swab of cells from inside the mouth. HIV testing can be done anonymously (meaning you don't give your name or any information that could be used to identify you) or confidentially (meaning test results are private and can't be released to anyone else). You can get tested for HIV through your private doctor, a clinic or by buying an HIV test kit through the Internet. However, we highly recommend seeing a health care provider, whether at a doctor's office or a clinic, for HIV testing. Just in case you test positive, it is much better to have some support from someone who is knowledgeable about it. For more information, check out the following sites: American Sexual Health Association The Body Want to get tested for HIV? Find a clinic near you.", "The Bases": "A slang expression that uses baseball to describe how far two people have gone sexually. Typically, first base refers to kissing, second based refers to touching above the waist, sloppy second refers to touching above the waist with the mouth, third base refers to touching each other's genitals or oral sex and fourth base or a home run refers to vaginal sex. Depending on where a person lives, the bases may be defined differently from that.", "Testes": "Testes (&#8220;balls&#8221;) is the plural of testis. Another word used for testes is \"testicles.\" The testes produce and store sperm cells as well as the sex hormone, testosterone. Testes are protected by a sack of skin beneath the penis called the scrotum.", "Pre-cum": "Also known as pre-ejaculate, a small amount of fluid that is made in the Cowper's gland and that comes out of the tip of the penis shortly after a boy or man gets an erection. It is designed to clean the urethra of urine and coat the walls to increase the chances of sperm surviving once they are ejaculated. Some males always have sperm in their pre-cum and others never do. Any sperm that is found in pre-cum is not likely to cause pregnancy. Pre-cum can transmit a sexually transmitted disease.", "Gaydar": "A term used to describe a person's self-proclaimed ability to, based on stereotypes, determine whether someone is lesbian, gay or bisexual. For example, a person might say, \"Wow, I was really surprised to find out that he was gay; my gaydar did not go off at all around him.\" Often used as a good-natured term by people of all orientations although it may be offensive by some people as having &#8220;gaydar&#8221; relies on stereotypes.", "Pubic Hair": "The coarse hair that typically grows around the penis and vulva.", "I want to be intimate with my partner, but I don't want to have sex. Is this possible?": "Yes, it's possible to be intimate with someone without having sex (vaginal, anal or oral). As you get to know a partner, you will discover lots of things that feel good and make you feel closer, but that don't necessarily include having sexual intercourse. These can be physical things, like touching and kissing, as well as non-physical things, like talking and sharing experiences together. Intimacy is when two people can be themselves and share their thoughts, feelings and emotions and be vulnerable without being afraid they will be laughed at or judged. Intimacy is an important element in a healthy relationship that involves sharing a feeling of emotional closeness with another person. When we have emotional intimacy, it's more comfortable to have physical closeness with that person. This is known as physical intimacy; it's not necessarily sexual. Sex can be a part of an intimate relationship, but friendships and other relationships can be intimate and never sexual. Even romantic partnerships can be intimate and not include sex. Intimacy can take a while to achieve; it usually occurs in committed, long-term relationships, romantic or otherwise. Intimacy between two people who trust and care for each other can be wonderful. The most important thing to do is talk with your partner before things get physical. Be very clear about what kind of touching is allowed and what's off limits. So, is kissing OK, but not other touching? Is touching above the waist OK, but not below? If you do not want to have sex but want to be physical, make a promise to each other that things will stop at a certain point. Then agree that both of you are responsible for sticking to those limits. The last thing you want is for sex to \"just happen,\" which is how some people end up facing an unplanned pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).", "Female Condom": "A polyurethane pouch that has two flexible rings on either end. One ring is inserted into the vagina and the other ring stays outside the vagina. The rings help to hold the condom in place. Female condoms are 79-percent effective with typical use in preventing pregnancy, and 95-percent effective with perfect use. They also offer protection against some sexually transmitted diseases. They can be purchased without a prescription and, when the inner ring is removed, can be used during anal intercourse as well. Female condoms should not be used at the same time as male condoms.", "Sodomy": "A legal term used to describe oral sex or anal intercourse.", "What is abstinence?": "While people might have different definitions of what abstinence is, most people would define it as not having sexual intercourse, including oral, anal or vaginal intercourse, for a particular period of time. Some people decide to remain abstinent until they're a certain age or are in a certain kind of committed relationship, like being in love, being with a person for a certain amount of time or married. Abstinence can mean different things to different people. Does it mean you'll have no intimate physical contact\u2014including holding hands or kissing\u2014with another person? Or is it OK to kiss, but no touching under the clothing? These are questions you have to ask yourself and your partner if you decide to remain abstinent. You can decide where you draw the line on what you want to do sexually. Once you've decided how you define abstinence, make it clear to your romantic partners that you're not interested in getting physical in these specific ways. You have to set specific limits if a relationship is getting romantic. You also have to be prepared for the possibility that your partner will have a different definition of abstinence than you, and that is the point when you either come to a compromise or decide that your boundaries are not a good fit for the other person. This is part of establishing and being in a healthy relationship. To succeed in sticking to your definition of abstinence, it's helpful to have supportive friends and family members. No matter what you decide, it's always best to keep your life goals clearly in focus, so you can stay committed to your own desires and values no matter what anyone else says or does. Choose what's right for you. As a final note, studies show that when teens that choose abstinence but don't practice it (meaning they wind up having sex ), they often don't use protection. We don't want that to happen to you. So if you decide to be abstinent, also make a promise to yourself to be informed about how to keep yourself healthy if you decide to have sex. Specifically, know how to use a condom, where to find a health center and how to get emergency contraception (EC) if you need it.

The virus comes in two strains (types) and causes small, painful sores on the genitals (HSV-2) or on or around the mouth (HSV-1). Even though one type is more common on the genitals and one is more common on or around the mouth, both types of herpes can be spread from genitals to genitals, mouth to mouth, mouth to genitals and genitals to mouth. A person can be infected with herpes and not have any symptoms. Or they may have mild symptoms that are mistaken for something else. When someone does have typical symptoms, they begin as blisters that then become sores, which are usually oozing and painful. These sores can appear anywhere around the mouth in the form of cold sores or fever blisters, or on the genitals or anus. During the first \"outbreak\" of sores, the sores typically dry up and heal in about two weeks. Later on, outbreaks are generally shorter and milder. A person may feel a tingling sensation around the area of the skin right before sores appear and may have a low-grade fever. A person is most contagious when the sores are visible, but the virus can also spread from the skin even when there are no sores on the mouth or genitals. Someone who experiences an outbreak of cold sores should not have oral sex , kiss or share drinking glasses or lip balm during the outbreak to prevent transmitting the virus to someone else. Condoms and other safer sex methods can be somewhat effective during a herpes outbreak, but may not cover the area of skin where sores are (or were) present. Because it is possible to transmit herpes from the mouth to the genitals or the genitals to the mouth, using a condom or dental dam for oral sex is important. Herpes is also the only STD that can be transmitted through kissing, though it is far easier to pass oral herpes when one kissing partner has an outbreak than when one doesn't. The herpes virus stays in a person's body their whole life, and outbreaks of sores can happen throughout life. Sometimes after a while, a person will get fewer outbreaks than they used to get or will stop getting outbreaks, but the virus is still in his or her body and can still be passed to another person. It is also important to remember that some people don't experience any symptoms or sores yet they are still infected. There's no cure for herpes, but there are medicines that can help reduce the pain, control the number of outbreaks, shorten the length of outbreaks and lower the risk of passing herpes to a sexual partner. A doctor or other health care provider can prescribe the medicine.

Also known as \"date\" rape.", "Dental Dam": "A thin square of latex used to cover the vulva during oral sex or the anus during analingus to reduce the risk of spread of sexually transmitted diseases. It is called a \"dental dam\" because it was created for use in dental procedures.", "What are yeast infections? How do you get rid of them?": "Yeast is a normal organism in the body; this includes the vagina. Sometimes too much yeast grows and can cause an infection. This can happen for different reasons. Sometimes antibiotics \u2014medicine taken for bacterial illnesses\u2014can actually lead to a yeast infection. That's because some antibiotics, while killing off \"bad\" bacteria, kill the \"good\" bacteria that keep yeast from growing too much. Changes in hormone levels\u2014either from pregnancy or taking birth control pills \u2014can also contribute to yeast infections. Yeast infections can also occur as a result of the vulva being damp for a long period of time (like staying in a wet bathing suit or exercise clothes for a long time). Some girls get yeast infections more than others. To reduce the chances of getting one, avoid wearing very tight pants and non-cotton underwear and try not to stay in wet clothes (a bathing suit or sweaty exercise clothes) for too long. Also, after going to the bathroom, be sure to wipe from front to back because wiping from back to front may spread bacteria from the anus to the vagina and cause a yeast infection or a urinary tract infection (UTI). Usually, the first symptom of a yeast infection is redness and itching around the vulva and inside the vagina. There can also be white, thick, clumpy discharge that looks like cottage cheese but doesn't smell. The vulva can be tender and sore or it may hurt to pee or have sex. Yeast infections can usually be treated with antifungal creams or suppositories (medicine inserted into the vagina). This medicine can be bought without a prescription at most drugstores or supermarkets, but before you try to treat a yeast infection, visit your health care provider to make sure you actually have a yeast infection. There are also prescription medicines available to treat a yeast infection that won't go away with medicines you can get in stores. Sometimes, though, a girl may think she has a yeast infection when in fact it may be a sexually transmitted disease ( STD ). This is because the symptoms of a yeast infection, like discharge from the vagina and burning and itching in the vagina or around the vulva, are also common symptoms of STDs. So even if you think you just have a yeast infection, it is best to speak with your health care provider to make sure it is not something more serious. Avoid having sex during a yeast infection. The medicine used to treat a yeast infection can weaken latex condoms and having sex while you have a yeast infection can make the infection worse. And although yeast infections are not considered an STD, a girl can pass a yeast infection to her sexual partner. Guys can get yeast infections too, especially if they are not circumcised.", "I think I'm ready. What should I do before I have sex?": "This is a great question. It shows that you're taking the time to think through this decision. Here are some things to consider when deciding whether becoming sexually active is what's right for you at this point in your life. It's important to think about all the potential things that could happen if you have sex with someone. There are good things\u2014pleasure, a feeling of closeness, maybe even a deepening in your relationship\u2014that lots of people think about. These things are more likely to happen when a couple knows and understands each other, communicates openly about their feelings, decides together that they're ready to have sex and uses condoms and/or birth control to protect against pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Then there are things that people sometimes tend to overlook or downplay\u2014STDs, an unplanned pregnancy or a change in the relationship that isn't positive. Anytime you have sex, there's a chance of getting an STD . And, if you're a heterosexual couple having sex, there's a chance of becoming pregnant. Using birth control and wearing condoms\u2014every single time\u2014reduces the chances of either of these things happening. With perfect use, hormonal birth control can be 99-percent effective at preventing pregnancy, but it does not prevent STDs. Condoms are 98-percent effective with perfect use at preventing pregnancy and are effective at protecting you from most STDs. Difficult changes in a relationship can happen when a couple hasn't taken the time to get to know each other before having sex. They haven't shared their feelings, expectations and desires for themselves and the relationship, or about what sex means to each of them. Jumping into a sexual relationship creates a greater likelihood of you or a partner being emotionally hurt. Here are some questions to ask yourself before you have sex: Do I feel pressured by anyone to have sex, including myself, my partner or my friends? What are my values and beliefs about sex and its role in relationships? Can I talk honestly about sex and all that comes with it with my partner? Have we talked about our sexual histories with each other yet? Do I feel ready to have an intimate sexual relationship with another person and with this person? Am I comfortable being naked with my partner and with seeing my partner naked? What would my parents or family think about me having sex? How would I feel if I didn't tell them? What does my religion or faith say about having a sexual relationship? How would we protect ourselves from STDs? How would I feel if having sex changed the relationship? What if it becomes more intense or my feelings change? If you're a heterosexual couple, other questions you might consider these questions too: What would I do if I or my partner became pregnant? What type of protection or birth control would we use? Where could we get it? Do I need to go to a clinic or see my health care provider ? Visit a clinic to learn more about your birth control options and to get condoms. Call 1-800-230-PLAN (7526) to locate a Planned Parenthood near you.", "What is a gynecologist, and when should I go? What will happen when I go to the gynecologist?": "What happens during a visit to the gynecologist depends on the reason you are going. If you aren't having a problem and you just want birth control, then you may not need to get undressed for an exam. When you call to make the appointment, feel free to ask your doctor or nurse if you will need a pelvic exam or Pap test, both of which would require you to get undressed. If your doctor recommends an exam for another reason, then you will probably go through most, if not all, of the following steps. The Exam First, you'll be asked to fill out a medical history form. Then, a clinician will talk to you privately about your sexual history. The questions can feel a little bit uncomfortable to answer, but it's really important to answer each one completely and honestly. That's the only way your health care provider can give you the information and services you need. Your medical records and history are usually confidential, meaning your health care provider won't tell anyone, like your parents, but you should check with the gynecologist you visit. Being open will help your gynecologist offer you the best care. Doctors, nurses or other health care providers aren't there to judge you; they just want to give you the best medical care possible. After giving your medical history, you might be asked to provide a urine sample, using a plastic cup in the privacy of the bathroom. Next, you will go into an examination room, where you'll undress and put on a paper or cloth gown. Once you've changed, a health care provider will come into the room for the exam. If you would prefer a clinician of a particular sex, you can request that ahead of time. In many cases, a female nurse will be present in the room during the exam regardless of the sex of the health care provider who is performing your exam. Your gynecologist will listen to your heart and lungs, check your thyroid and may ask you to lie down for a breast exam. Some gynecologists may teach you how to examine your own breasts and feel for any unusual lumps or swellings that might need medical care. After the breast exam, the doctor will examine your abdomen, feeling the size and shape of your reproductive organs and check for anything unusual. Then, you'll be asked to lie on your back on the exam table and to slide down to the edge of the exam table and place your feet in what are called stirrups so that your legs are spread open. This position makes it easier for the gynecologist to examine the vulva and check both inside and outside the vaginal area. She or he will use a bright light to see better. Usually, the gynecologist will check the labia and vulva for the general health of the skin. If you have been sexually active for at least three years or are 21 or older, the gynecologist will then insert a metal or plastic device called a speculum into the vagina. The speculum holds open the vaginal walls so the gynecologist can see the cervix, the tip and opening of the uterus, inside of the vagina. During this part of the exam, the doctor can also test for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). If the doctor tests for STDs, they usually use a long cotton swab to take a sample from inside the vagina and sometimes from the cervix. The gynecologist will also gently rub the cervix with something similar to a tongue depressor (but smaller) to collect some of the cells from the cervical opening and near it. These cells are examined under a microscope at a lab. This is called a Pap test, which tests for irregular cells on the cervix that could indicate a pre-cancerous condition. The Pap test is generally painless as the cervix does not have many nerve endings, but the experience can be different for all girls. After the Pap test, the gynecologist removes the speculum and inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into the vagina while gently pressing on the abdomen with the other hand. This is called a bimanual, which means \"two handed,\" exam. The gynecologist is checking the position and size of the uterus and ovaries to be sure everything is healthy. The pelvic exam shouldn't be painful, but some parts of it can feel a little uncomfortable. Try to relax and breathe deeply. It only lasts a few minutes. If you feel any pain, tell the gynecologist right away so she or he can work with you to make the experience as comfortable as possible. After the exam, before or after you get dressed, the gynecologist will ask if you have questions. This is when the gynecologist can prescribe birth control or any other medications and address any of your health concerns. Doctors recommend that you get a checkup with a gynecologist between the ages of 13 and 15, and that you get a pelvic exam, which we will describe later, by the time you are 21 years old. This also includes girls who have sex with girls only. Visits to the gynecologist should continue every year of your life to ensure good health, although you may not need the entire exam every year. It may help you to read a personal account of a teen's first visit to a gynecologist. How to Find a Gynecologist The best way is to ask a parent, guardian or other trusted adult (maybe an aunt or older cousin) to recommend a doctor they trust. Maybe they'll even go with you on your first visit. If you do not want to see the same doctor as your parent or another adult you know, ask her gynecologist to recommend a colleague who is good with teens. Many health clinics are free or offer reduced (sliding-scale) fees to teens who don't have much money. For example, Planned Parenthood health centers offer low-cost, confidential health care to teens. To find the Planned Parenthood nearest you, call 1-800-230-PLAN (7526) or find a clinic near you. Most health clinics keep these visits confidential and will not share a patient's medical information with anyone without permission, even if you're under 18. If you're using your parents' health insurance, however, the visit might show up on their bill, and your visit will not stay confidential. To find out what a health clinic's confidentiality policy is, ask when you call to make an appointment.", "Flaccid": "This refers to when a penis is soft and un-aroused rather than erect.", "Hand Job": "A slang term for manual stimulation of another person&#8217;s genitals. It usually refers to touching and stimulating a person&#8217;s penis.", "What is body image? Can it change?": "Body image is the picture that you have in your head of what you look like. Your body image is created from a bunch of different things. It's based on things like what you know from school about health and nutrition, how your relatives look, how your friends and family talk about bodies and all of the images you see on TV and in movies and magazines. The messages we get about bodies are mixed-up and even disagree with each other. Learning about body image can help you sort these messages out and have a healthier body image. Your body image can and does change. Your body image can change from day to day, and it can change from year to year. Sometimes you wake up in the morning and feel great! Other days, you just don't feel so good. Your body image can also change as you grow older and your body changes. A key to a healthy body image is appreciating what you like about your body\u2014from particular features to your body's health, strength or physical abilities. If you feel you have an unhealthy body image, time can change how you think of yourself and your body, especially if you learn to focus on things that make you feel good about yourself on the inside and outside.", "Discrimination": "Unfair or unequal treatment of somebody because of their age, sexual orientation, sex, race, color, national origin, religion, gender, gender expression, veteran status or disability.

Because the fluid is slippery, it is referred to as her being \"wet.\"", "All my partner wants is sex, and I consider myself a little too young. How can I tell him or her that I don't want to have sex without embarrassing my partner or hurting the relationship?": "It's nice that you want to spare your partner's feelings, but it's also your feelings that matter in this situation. People have a right to set boundaries in their relationships and to have those boundaries respected. Being straightforward and honest about those boundaries is an example of healthy communication. Let your partner know that you're not out to embarrass or hurt him or her and you just want to open up the lines of communication regarding a boundary that you have. Remember that you can't control your partner's reaction, but your boundaries are still important and should be respected. Explain to your partner why you feel that having sex isn't the best option for you. A partner who cares about and respects you won't pressure you to have sex before you're ready. When talking about sexual boundaries with your partner, be honest and straightforward before things get sexual. Find a time to talk privately, preferably out of a sexual situation. Know what you want to say before you sit down to talk. You could start by telling your partner how you feel about your relationship. Discuss the things you like about your partner and the time you spend together. This will help your partner know that your decision to say no to certain sexual behaviors isn't a rejection; it's an important personal choice that you've chosen to communicate. Then explain why you don't want to do certain sexual things. Share your feelings so your partner understands why those sexual behaviors aren't right for you right now. Know your sexual boundaries and communicate them clearly. Is kissing OK, but touching isn't? Should clothes stay on? If so, which ones? What can your partner expect if you change your mind? It might help to let your partner know that it is OK for him or her to say no to you as well. As far as your relationship goes, not having sex doesn't mean you want to end the relationship. Be clear about this if you want to stay in the relationship. If you two are together because you really like and care for each other, then letting your partner know how you feel may help to bring you closer. There are a lot of ways to feel close to a partner besides having sex, and they're not all physical. This could be a great time to talk with your partner about what you are comfortable doing that would help you feel closer to your partner. An important part of being sexually healthy is knowing what your values and limits are when it comes to all kinds of sexual behavior. Values are the important things that matter to you and limits refer to how far you want a relationship or sexual situation to go. Once you know your values and limits, share them with your partner as part of a healthy relationship. People say no to a lot of things in relationships, not just sexual things. For example, you may not want to go to parties where there's alcohol, or you may only want to hang out socially on the weekends. These are boundaries too, just as sexual boundaries are boundaries.", "What is oral sex, and how do you do it? Is it really sex?": "Oral sex is when a person uses their mouth to sexually stimulate the genitals of another person. Oral sex performed on a female usually means licking or sucking the clitoris and other parts of the vulva (external genitals). It's also called cunnilingus. You've probably heard it called \" eating out.\" Oral sex performed on a male can mean sucking or licking the penis. It's called fellatio. You've probably heard it called other things, like \" blow job.\" Slang words can be confusing because their meanings are not always clear. For example, \"blow job\" has nothing to do with blowing; \"eating out\" does not involve chewing. And certain slang words may be offensive to some people. There is no \"right\" way to perform oral sex on someone because different people enjoy different things. The specifics need to be explored by each pair of people with a little creativity and a lot of honest communication. That means you have to try different things and ask your partner what they like or don't like. Oral sex can give physical pleasure and orgasms, so it's definitely a sexual behavior. Some people think oral sex is really intimate and means two people are really close to each other. Others see it as less intimate than vaginal intercourse. Everyone has to decide for themselves what values they place on each sexual behavior. The important thing is to stay true to yourself and do things that feel comfortable for you. Oral Sex and Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) It's important to know the potential risks that come with any sexual behavior. STDs can be transmitted if partners are having unprotected oral sex. Some people like the idea of allowing a partner to ejaculate in their mouth or swallowing their partner's vaginal fluids; others are completely turned off by the idea. But anytime pre-ejaculatory fluid, semen or vaginal fluids enter the body, whether through the mouth or another opening, there's a risk of transmitting an STD if either partner has one. It's tough to tell whether a person has an infection. Sometimes, people have infections and don't even know it. One way to reduce your risk of an STD when giving (or receiving) oral sex is to use a latex barrier, like a flavored condom or a dental dam. With knowledge of the risks, it's equally important to consider your own comfort with the behavior in general. You get to decide what's comfortable for you; don't let a partner talk you into something that's not OK with you. You should never feel pressured to do something in a sexual situation. If you don't feel comfortable and safe, the experience will not be pleasant for you and will likely not be pleasant for your partner, either.", "Pap Test": "A medical test that examines cells from a girl's or woman's cervix to determine whether there are any irregular cells that could indicate a pre-cancerous condition. During a pelvic exam, a gynecologist or other clinician will gently scrape the cervix with an instrument to collect some of the cells near the opening to the cervix. These cells are placed on a slide and examined under a microscope at a lab. Doctors recommend that girls and young women make an appointment to see a gynecologist for a Pap test when they turn 21. Girls and women who have sex with other girls and women should also have a Pap test when they turn 21. Once a girl or woman starts to have Pap tests, regardless of the sex of her partner, she should have them every three years after that.", "Anus": "The opening from the rectum through which feces (poop) leaves the body.", "Head": "A slang term for oral sex being performed on a guy or girl.", "Judicial Bypass": "If a minor wants to have an abortion and lives in a state that requires parental consent before she can get one, she can go before a judge to ask permission. The judge will then decide whether she can obtain an abortion without her parents' knowledge. This process is called a judicial bypass.", "Ovulation": "The release of an ovum (egg) from an ovary each month. Although the timing of ovulation can vary widely, especially when girls are younger, ovulation typically takes place approximately 14 days after the first day of a girl or woman's last period.", "Foreplay": "All of the sexual activities that people might do to get each other sexually aroused either before or instead of intercourse.", "Clitoris": "A small, highly sensitive organ located above the opening to the vagina whose only function is sexual pleasure. Direct stimulation of the clitoris can lead to orgasm in some women but can be uncomfortable for other women.", "Questioning": "Someone who is not sure what their sexual orientation or gender identity is and is going through the process of figuring out how they feel.", "I like some things about being a girl and some things about being a guy. Is this normal?": "Yes! As human beings we all have characteristics, interests, feelings and talents that could be traditionally defined as \"masculine\" or \"feminine.\" One thing to keep in mind is that society's ideas of masculine or feminine change over time. For example, less than 100 years ago people thought pink was the best color for boy babies and blue was best for girls. Society's ideas can change over time, and we can have a lot to do with changing them! Lots of people hide this about themselves because they are afraid others won't understand. Sometimes guys who like \"girl\" things and girls who like \"guy\" things get labeled weird or are considered gay. Some people don't know or don't understand the difference between sexual orientation and gender. Rigid expectations of people based on their gender limit everyone. If you like shaking things up a bit, challenge assumptions and stereotypes when you feel it is safe to do so. The more people speak out, the more there is a chance they will find others who feel just like they do. Here are some questions you can ask: Why is one color OK for girls but not for guys? What can guys and girls learn from playing with a variety of toys? How do people express themselves with others? Is there a difference in the kinds of expressions of guys or girls? How might this affect people's relationships? How do these ideas change over time? What kind of jewelry did men wear 100 years ago? Does place or culture make a difference? How are ideas about sex and gender roles different for people living in different parts of the U.S.? Around the world? Check out this clip, \"Gend-o-meter,\" from the documentary Straightlaced to see what other teens have to say about gender expectations.", "Intrauterine Device": "A contraceptive device that is inserted in the uterus. It works by preventing fertilization and/or implantation of a fertilized egg. IUDs are 99-percent effective with perfect use at preventing pregnancy. Prescribed and inserted by a health care provider, they cost several hundred dollars. This is not a method that was recommended or used by many teens and young women in the past because it typically prescribed after the birth of one or more children for women who want long-term protection against pregnancy but do not want to be surgically sterilized and who are not at risk for sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ). However, they are now being recommended for young women even if they have never had a child.", "Menstrual Cycle": "This is the monthly process in the female body, which involves the release of an egg (ovum), the build-up of the lining of the uterus in preparation for a possible pregnancy and the release of the lining if no pregnancy occurs. Most menstrual cycles last about 28 days, but every girl's cycle can be different\u2014some cycles are longer and some are shorter.", "What is statutory rape?": "Statutory rape is when someone has sex with someone who is under that state's age of consent. It's illegal, even if both people say they wanted to have sex. To find out more about age of consent laws for your state, check out Sex in the States. The idea behind these laws is that children and teens under a certain age may be too young to decide for themselves whether to have sex. Also, the laws protect young people from older teens and adults who might force or manipulate young people into doing sexual things. Statutory rape can include sexual intercourse or other types of sexual contact. It can happen between people of the same or different sexes. Also, the older person can go to jail for doing it, regardless of whether they are male or female or whether the younger person agreed to have sex.", "Opt-In Policy": "A school policy that typically pertains to sexuality education courses, but can pertain to other content as well. It is a policy where parents have to give permission for their children to take human sexuality education course when it is offered at school. Most schools tell parents when their children will be taking a sexuality education class. In some school districts, parents have to sign and return a permission slip agreeing to let their children take the course. That is called an \"opt-in\" policy, and unless parents give their permission their children will be taken out of those classes.", "Pimp": "A slang term for a guy who has had or is perceived to have had many sexual partners. The term really refers to a man who is in charge of women who he prostitutes out. The women have sex for money and the pimp gets part of that money. Often the pimp is physically, emotionally, financially and sexually abusive to these women.", "Consensual": "A behavior that both people agree to. In order for any sexual behavior to be consensual, each person must fully understand the situation and have the capacity to consent. &#8220;Consensual sex&#8221; means that no one was forced or manipulated into sexual behavior. If someone consents to one specific sexual behavior it does not mean that they have consented to all sexual behaviors.", "Will my child wonder why I chose adoption?": "It's certainly possible that one day your child will have questions. Plus, many adoptions today are open adoptions, meaning birth parents can continue to be involved in their child's life in some way, either through letters and pictures or by actually visiting the adoptive family. This would give you a chance to explain to your child why you chose adoption if you choose an open adoption.", "I'm not circumcised, is there anything special I need to do for my sexual health if I have an uncircumcised penis? Also, I'm afraid that when I have sex, my partner will be grossed out. What can I do?": "A guy with an uncircumcised penis should clean under the foreskin to prevent infection and keep the skin moving freely over the head of the penis. Sometimes, the foreskin will roll back naturally. If not, then you should pull it back away from the head of the penis to wash under it. If there's any pain when pulling back the foreskin, see a doctor. Sometimes, uncircumcised penises get adhesions\u2014places where the foreskin is stuck to the penis\u2014but they're easily treated. Until recently, most baby boys in the U.S. were circumcised, usually just days after birth. In some cases, circumcision is performed during a religious ceremony. Circumcision, when not done for religious reasons, historically happened commonly because many believed that it kept the penis cleaner. Now, circumcision is less common. In many countries, the majority of guys aren't circumcised. The point is that everyone is different. Lots of guys worry about how their partners will react to their penis, whether they are circumcised or uncircumcised. Whether you're circumcised or uncircumcised, it's just another part of what makes your body unique. The right partner will accept you\u2014and all your body parts\u2014just the way you are.", "I'm on the Pill and my partner and I have been tested for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Can we stop using condoms?": "It's great that you're using contraception and that you've been tested for STDs. That shows that you're taking responsibility for your sexual health. We recommend that you continue to use male or female condoms for two reasons. First, the birth control pill is good at preventing pregnancy as long as you take it at about the same time every day. If you forget to take the Pill, the chance of pregnancy increases, so condoms give you extra protection. In addition, the Pill is not 100-percent effective; even if you take it consistently, there's still a slight chance of pregnancy. Therefore, using the Pill and a condom each time you have sex reduces the chance of pregnancy. Secondly, the birth control pill does not provide protection from STDs. Research shows that many teens begin relationships using condoms and birth control, but then stop using condoms later on. At this point, they are unprotected from STDs, and while they think their partner isn't with anyone else, sometimes people cheat. Obviously this doesn't apply to everyone, but with the added benefit of increased pregnancy protection, why not keep the condoms in the picture? Also, many times STDs don't have any symptoms, and you or your partner may just be a carrier so you don't know the STD is present. It's best to protect each other from the possibility of pregnancy or STDs. Got a question about STDs? Visit the American Sexual Health Association (ASHA) website or call ASHA's Sexually Transmitted Infection Resource Center Hotline at 1-919-361-8488.", "I'm afraid that my vagina is too smelly to have oral sex. What should I do?": "Lots of girls and women are concerned about this. Many guys are concerned about how they will smell or taste when someone's performing oral sex on them, too. If you're healthy and take regular showers or baths, then only a normal scent and taste will be present. Every girl's vagina and every guy's penis has a natural scent to it. This is perfectly normal. If a girl is especially concerned about her smell, she can gently wash the vulva (the external sex organs, including the clitoris, the labia and the vaginal opening ) with water and mild soap before doing anything sexual. A guy who is concerned can wash his penis and scrotum with water and mild soap as well. What you eat and drink can affect your scent. Eating lots of fruits and vegetables, avoiding high-fat food (like chips, fast food, etc.) and drinking a lot of water rather than sodas or other sugary drinks can help maintain a girl's vaginal health.", "Queef": "Also known as vaginal farting. It happens when a small amount of air is forced out of a girl's or woman's vagina, such as during vaginal sex or other sexual behaviors that involve something being inserted into the vagina, or when she is doing certain exercises (such as squats) on her own.", "Hormonal injection": "When a chemical (progestin) that is made to act like the natural hormones already in the human body is injected into a woman's body every three months to prevent pregnancy. In the United States, this shot is called Depo-Provera. Hormonal injections do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases.", "Vaginal Lubrication": "Fluid that is released from the walls of the vagina when a girl or woman is sexually aroused.", "Why does my partner always have an orgasm during sex, but I don't?": "There are lots of reasons why one partner may have an orgasm while the other doesn't. Couples need to be able to speak openly and honestly with one another about what feels good, what they want, and if they're comfortable with what's happening. Stress, worry or anxiety can also get in the way of a pleasurable experience. Of course, orgasm doesn't need to be the only goal of having sex. If someone is so focused on an orgasm, it can actually be harder to have one because they're not focused on the sensations of what's going on. Sex is about sharing physical and emotional pleasure with another person, and lots of sexual behaviors that people engage in can bring that pleasure, not just the orgasm.", "Sponge": "A contraceptive device containing spermicide that is inserted into the vagina and pushed up against the cervix to provide a barrier against and release chemicals to kill sperm.", "Queer": "A name some people who are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender (LGBT) use as an affirmation of their sexual orientation or gender identity as different and wonderful, as in \"I&#8217;m queer and proud.\" By using an historically negative word, some LGBT people are trying to erase the negativity associated with it. It is important to note that not all LGBT people use the term queer, and it should not be used by people who are heterosexual or cisgender to describe LGBT people.", "Closeted": "A term that refers to a person who does not tell others their sexual orientation or gender identity. Sometimes referred to as being &#8220;in the closet.&#8221;", "I'm a girl, and sometimes I worry about the way I look \"down there.\" I don't like how my labia look, and I'm afraid my partner will be grossed out. How do I know if I'm normal?": "A lot of girls have this concern. They do not like the way their vulva looks. The thing is though that everyone's vulva is unique and special. If you looked at pictures of vulvas, you would find that vulvas are all very different, and there is no such thing as \"normal\" or the \"right way\" for a vulva to look. Since people don't get a chance to see a lot of other vulvas, it's harder to compare what your vulva looks like. All vulvas are different, just like faces or any other body parts vary from person to person. One way to find out what yours looks like is to take a look at yourself with a mirror in the comfort of your own private setting. Just like your smile, your eyes, your hands or any other part of your body, your genitals are unique to you. Your partner is with you for who you are and may be feeling the same fear about his or her genitals. Talk with your partner.", "What are the pros and cons of adoption? Who can help me make the decision about whether or not to choose adoption for my child?": "There are many pros and cons to think about. Here's our list of things to take into consideration. Possible Pros Adoption is an option for people who feel unready or unable to raise a child at this time but can't get an abortion or don't want to have one. Some birth parents that choose adoption do so because they feel adoption provides their child with a loving, stable home and parent(s) or guardian(s) who have the financial resources to support a child. There is also the possibility of kinship adoption where a family member, like a sibling, parent or grandparent, actually adopts and raises the child. That way, the child remains in the extended family, so there's an increased chance that you can have a lot of contact and a relationship with your child. Possible Cons Choosing adoption means being pregnant for nine months and then giving custody of the child to someone else. This can be very traumatic. In the case of a closed adoption\u2014when the birth mother's contact information is kept private\u2014some adopted children wish to meet their birth parents, and vice versa. Some find each other after long searches and develop meaningful relationships; others find the person and, for a variety of reasons, never establish a relationship. Still others never find their parent or child. For some parents or children, that can be upsetting or challenging to imagine or deal with. You are the person who has to live with your decision to place your child for adoption, become a teen parent or get an abortion. It's important to make sure you get the support you need to make this important decision in a way that's right for you. It can help to talk to a trusted adult, parent or guardian during this process. A counselor or therapist can help you to sort out your feelings and to help you make the best decision for you. You can find a counselor in several ways: A family planning clinic, such as Planned Parenthood at 1-800-230-PLAN (7526) Health Department centers or social services Mental health center or family service agency (search online for \"social services,\" \"family social services\" or \"family counseling services\" in your area or zip code) A counselor's job is to help you sort out your feelings, so you can make a decision that feels right for you. Even if the counselor has strong feelings about adoption, abortion or teen parenting, they should not try to influence your decision. If you ever feel like your counselor is biased or is not providing you with a balanced environment to sort out your feelings, try to find another person to help you. This decision is entirely yours. \" Crisis pregnancy centers \" offer misleading and medically inaccurate information about abortion in order to convince women to choose adoption.

In most states you can set up a private or non-agency adoptions, which means that the bi r th parents and adoptive parents handle everything, usually with the help of an attorney. But the laws vary from state to state. To find out about the laws concerning private adoptions in your state you can do a search on the Child Welfare site. Private adoption agencies arrange most infant adoptions. There are several types of private adoption agencies. Some are for profit and some are nonprofit. Some couples will hire an attorney and advertise in the newspaper for birth mothers. If you decide to go to an adoption agency, social workers there can answer all of your questions. Here are some things to ask: Will I get counseling during my pregnancy, after I sign the adoption papers and after my baby goes to his or her adoptive family? Can my baby's father and other people important to me join me in the counseling if they want to? What kind of financial, legal and medical help can I get? Can I get help with medical and legal expenses? Can I choose the adoptive parents? Can I meet them? Will I get to know about my baby after the adoption? The agency social worker will ask questions about you and the baby's father, such as your medical histories, age, race and physical characteristics, whether you have seen a doctor since you became pregnant, whether you smoked cigarettes, took any drugs or drank any alcohol since you became pregnant. The social worker asks these questions so that he or she can has all of the information he or she needs to make a good placement for the baby and adoptive parents.

A drag queen is a man who dresses as a woman and a drag king is a woman who dresses like a man. Often people who perform in drag have a stage name and impersonate famous figures by singing and doing comedy for an audience.", "Why is it important to tell my doctor I'm gay or trans?": "When your doctor knows about your sexual orientation and gender identity, he or she can give you even better health care. Your doctor can ask you specific questions about your sexual practices and know what kinds of tests he or she should run. For example, if a woman is regularly having sex with other women, then the doctor can talk to her about safer sex methods between women. If a person is regularly having anal sex with men, then the doctor will be more likely to give that person an anal pap smear for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). If you are taking hormones, then your doctor can be sure not to prescribe something that will react badly with testosterone or estrogen. A good doctor will also keep in mind STD screening and treatment, hormone levels, what language to use with you (like the word \"partner\" or \"girlfriend\" or \"boyfriend\" or your preferred gender pronouns), counseling, cancer risk, parenting, depression, alcohol use, smoking and violence. The bottom line is that the more your doctor knows about you, the better health care he or she can provide. You may be afraid to come out to your doctor if you've had bad experiences coming out to other people in the past. But if you can muster the courage to come out to your doctor, you will be able to have a more open conversation about your behavior and your health risks. If you are sure that your doctor would not react well, then take the time to research gay &#8211; or lesbian -friendly or trans-friendly doctors in your area. You can get help from the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association website. As with any doctor, if you think you aren't getting the best health care, then switch doctors. This is always your right as a patient. Also, the more you learn and the more educated you are as a patient, the more you can advocate for your health and proper and respectful health care. It is also important for medical providers to have information about who you want involved in your health care. You can tell a doctor that you have a \"family of choice\" or a preferred emergency contact for them to call in case of an emergency. If you aren't specific, they may call your blood relatives or not allow your partner to visit you in the hospital. Also, be sure to ask what papers you need to sign to make this a legal request.", "Vaginal Opening": "The largest of three openings between a girl or woman's legs.

What's going on?": "It is not unusual for girls to experience irregular periods when they first start menstruating. A girl might skip a period and then have a longer or shorter period. Then she might go back to a regular period. Also, some may have irregular periods throughout their lives. There are several reasons why a girl might miss a period, including some of the following: Her period hasn't become regular yet Stress Strict dieting, over-exercising or being a competitive athlete Medication Gaining or losing a lot of weight over a short period of time A missed period can also be the first sign of a pregnancy. If a girl has had unprotected vaginal intercourse with a guy, then it is important to find out whether she is pregnant as soon as possible. She can get a home pregnancy test from a drugstore or grocery store or, better yet, make an appointment with her doctor or clinician. Learn more about the menstrual cycle or find a clinic near you.", "How do I use a condom?": "In order for a condom to work correctly, it must be put on following the right steps. It also must be used consistently\u2014meaning, each and every time a person has vaginal, oral or anal sex \u2014and correctly. \"Correctly\" means following the steps below, each and every time. When a condom breaks, it's usually because one of these steps wasn't followed. Luckily, condoms come with instructions, so you can read them there instead of checking online! There are also several good demonstration videos online to help you. The directions should cover these same steps: Check the expiration date. This should be clearly printed on the box and on the condom wrapper. If the condoms have expired, even by only a few days, do not use them. The material that they are made of and the lubricants they might have on them can break down over time, which means they're more likely to break if they're past expiration. When you store a condom to use it later, keep it in a cool, dry place, so as not to damage it. In practical terms, this means that you shouldn't keep condoms in your pocket or wallet for a long time. Leaving them in a car for a long period of time is also a bad idea. When you are in a situation where you are about to have anal or vaginal sex, open the package carefully (don't use your fingernails\u2014and don't use your teeth!), and remove the condom from the wrapper. Condoms are rolled up when they come out of the package. Therefore, you need to figure out which is the inside and which is the outside of the condom. How do you tell? Hold the condom so it looks like a hat, with the thick, rolled-up part on the outside. As you look at it, you'll be able to see how you would roll it easily over an erect penis. Pinch the tip of the condom to squeeze the air out of the condom. This will allow semen to collect in the tip at the top. The condom could break if the tip is not squeezed and air bubbles are let in, so keep pinching it the whole time. Keep pinching the tip as you place the condom on the head of the erect penis. Keep pinching the tip with one hand as you roll the condom all the way down to the base of the penis with the other hand. After ejaculation (which doesn't always happen) grasp the condom at the base of the penis and remove the penis (with the condom still on it) from your partner's body. Turn away from your partner's vagina or anus and carefully remove the condom from the penis. You can tie a knot at the end once it's off so no semen dumps out. Wrap the condom in a tissue and throw it away. Do not flush it down the toilet. NEVER reuse a condom. To practice safer oral sex, you can use a flavored latex condom. There are many varieties of flavored condoms. For oral sex on a penis, follow the instructions above. When ejaculation happens, remove the penis from your partner's mouth, then remove and discard the condom in the same way as described above. For oral sex on a vulva or anus, cut off the elastic ring at the base of the condom, then cut the condom open with scissors. The condom will now look more like a sheet of latex. Place it on your partner's vulva or anus with the flavored side up. There are also latex sheets available, called \"latex dams\" or \"dental dams,\" which can also be used for oral sex on a partner. When used correctly and consistently, condoms are highly effective at preventing HIV and pregnancy and also very effective at preventing other STDs. If you are having vaginal sex and the condom breaks, check out this info on emergency contraception. Do you know how to use a condom properly? Play The Condom Game to test your knowledge! Have you ever heard of the female condom ? It does exist!", "Breeder": "A slang term for a heterosexual person that is usually derogatory.", "Masturbation": "The touching of one's own body, especially the genitals, for sexual pleasure.", "Vaginal Discharge": "The small amount of fluid that is released every day from a vagina. On a typical day, its purpose is to clean the vagina. The amount and consistency of fluid released varies throughout the month. When a girl or woman is getting close to ovulation, the discharge will be thin and stringy, almost like an egg white; other days it may be cloudy or yellowish. If the discharge is ever greenish or greyish or has a foul or musty smell, it may mean that a girl or woman has an infection and she should make an appointment with a healthcare provider right away.", "I'm lesbian, gay or bisexual. Should I tell my parent(s)/guardian(s)? How do you think they'll react?": "This is a tough decision to make and, ultimately, only you will know if and when you should tell your parents. But Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG), an organization with chapters all over the U.S., offers some tips. PFLAG says many lesbian and gay teens that come out to their parents feel closer to them afterward because the relationship is more honest. They feel relieved not to be keeping such a big part of themselves a secret anymore. But sometimes parents aren't so understanding. Some parents force their teens to leave home. Some get abusive. And some family relationships are never the same. Before you come out to your parents, think about a few things: How do your parents react to gay people in general? Listen to what they say about lesbian, gay and bisexual people and ask some indirect questions. Do they have any lesbian, gay or bisexual friends? Do they read books or go to movies that include same- sex relationships? Does their religion accept lesbian, gay and bisexual people? Have you heard them say negative things about lesbian, gay or bisexual people? And think about your relationship with your parents. Do they show love for you, even when they're mad at you? Are they supportive of you, even when you do things they don't like? Honestly answering these questions should help you gauge your parents' reaction to telling them you're gay, lesbian or bisexual. If you think they will take it so badly they might throw you out of the house, then don't tell them until you have a safe place to stay. You might even decide never to tell them because they won't understand. Trust your gut. It's normal to be scared to tell your parents, but if you're terrified, then hold off until you feel more comfortable.", "My partner just got tested and found out that s/he has a sexually transmitted disease (STD). I'm upset and scared. I'm not sure how to react. Could I have an STD? Should I get tested?": "It's really great that your partner was so open and honest about his or her STD testing results. A lot of times it's really hard to talk to a partner about your STD status, so the fact that your partner communicated with you is really great. It says that your partner wants to make sure you get tested and treated, if necessary. It also says that he or she cares about your sexual health and that your partner feels like he or she can communicate with you. These are all good things. It's normal to feel taken a back or a bit shocked at first. However, once you let that pass there are a few things you'll need to do. First, talk to your current partner. Thank your partner for telling you and then ask when he or she got tested and what STD he or she tested positive for. If you and your partner have engaged in sexual behaviors, you'll need to be tested for STDs to know if you have the same STD. It's helpful to tell a health care provider which STD you think you might be at risk for. Second, you'll want to get tested for STDs also, even if you were recently tested. You can get tested by your health care provider, or get tested at a local free or low-cost and confidential clinic. Find a clinic near you. They can also help you get treatment if you test positive for an STD. It is important to follow instructions from a health care provider, including taking any medications exactly as directed. This will help ensure a full cure for a bacterial STD (such as chlamydia, gonorrhea or syphilis) and will also help with symptoms and reduce the risk of passing a viral STD (like herpes or HPV). Lastly, but certainly not least, you'll want to notify any past partners if there is a chance your current partner contracted the STD from you. It's really hard sometimes to tell who gave whom an STD. If you've engaged in sexual behaviors with people other than your current partner, you'll want to reach out and tell them that they may want to be tested for STDs. Remember, over 50 percent of sexually active people will get an STD by age 25. So having to deal with an STD is not unusual. Visit the American Sexual Health Association 's website for more information about STDs.", "Urethra": "A tube that carries urine from the bladder to outside the body. In boys and men, the urethra is also a passageway through which semen and sperm leave the body. In girls and women who ejaculate, this fluid also leaves the body through the urethra.", "What is vaginal sex?": "Vaginal sex (also called vaginal intercourse ) is one of many ways for a couple to give and receive pleasure. Vaginal sex is when an erect penis is inserted into a vagina. Both people move together to create pleasure and possibly orgasm. For couples who choose to have vaginal sex, the most effective way to avoid a pregnancy or sexually transmitted disease ( STD ) is by using both hormonal birth control, like the Pill, and a condom.", "Cowper&#8217;s Glands": "A pair of glands in the male reproductive system that are responsible for secreting a fluid that makes up pre-ejaculate (pre-cum) and the fluids surrounding sperm in semen or ejaculate.", "I'm a gay, lesbian, bisexual, trans or questioning (LGBTQ) teen, and I'd like to meet other LGBTQ teens. Where can I do that?": "One of the best ways to meet other LGBTQ teens in a welcoming environment is in a support or alliance group. These groups bring together LGBTQ youth to discuss issues like coming out or discrimination. They also help LGBTQ youth make new friends and have a good time in a supportive environment. Depending on where you live, there may be a group in your school, such as a gay &#8211; straight alliance ( GSA ), or in your community, often organized by teen centers or clinics. If you live in an area without an existing group, consider starting one. YouthResource also has excellent search engines for LGBTQ groups and has advice on starting one of your own. The YouthResource site also includes links to safe online communities, which are a good way to meet other teens if you live in an area where you cannot find or create a suitable group. As you meet people online, just remember these safety guidelines to make sure you are meeting people who have your best interests in mind: Use sites that are designed for and used by other teenagers. Never give out personal information, such as your real name, e-mail address, home address, phone number, school name, etc. Read everything someone posts with a critical eye. In other words, you can't believe everything you read. Take everything with a grain of salt until you've verified it. Never meet anyone you meet online face to face, except in a public place with other people present and with your parents' or guardians' permission. Don't tolerate harassment. You never deserve it, and life's too short to put up with it. If harassment continues through e-mail, text or IM, get help. Your local police station can locate users through their IP address and press charges to make them stop.", "Safer Sex": "Being responsible about shared sexual behaviors by doing things that reduce your chances of getting or spreading a sexually transmitted disease and/or becoming (or getting a girl) pregnant. Usually, this means educating oneself about STDs and pregnancy, using latex barriers like condoms and dental dams, limiting the number of partners a person has, and getting tested for STDs on a regular basis. Because nothing is 100 percent safe, aside from continuous abstinence, the term is \"safer\" rather than \"safe\" sex.", "Mandatory Waiting Period": "A waiting period that is required by state law. It is most commonly used to refer to girls and women seeking abortions. Not all states have waiting periods. The most up-to-date information on state abortion laws can be found at the National Abortion Federation 's Web site", "Age of Consent": "The age when a person is legally able to consent to sexual behaviors.

Some people use the word &#8220;condom&#8221; to refer to the female condom, which is a polyurethane pouch that has two flexible rings on either end. One ring is inserted into the vagina and the other ring stays just outside of the vaginal opening.", "My partner is pressuring me to take drugs or get drunk before we have sex. What should I do? What should I say?": "Alcohol and drugs do NOT make sex better. Alcohol and other drugs affect the way we're feeling, but they don't make sex better. Alcohol can make someone feel less uncomfortable and less inhibited\u2014which can be really bad in a sexual situation. Ask yourself why a partner is pressuring you to take illegal and potentially dangerous drugs, during sex or otherwise. In a healthy relationship, people exhibit respect for each other; this includes not asking a partner to do things that are harmful. This may be a good time to re-examine your relationship and to decide whether it is healthy for you to remain in it. People become less uncomfortable when they drink because alcohol slows down their brains. Alcohol makes it harder to make a decision about whether you really want to do something sexual. It also lowers inhibitions, which means that it becomes easier (in the moment) to do something you wouldn't do when you're sober. You still have to deal with the decision you made when you get sober, and that's a hard situation for lots of teens who've done things when they're drunk. The same is true for drugs, since they make you feel differently and can help you to make different decisions than you would when you're not on them. Alcohol and other drugs can also make it difficult to remember how to use a condom or make it seem like it's no big deal to have sex with someone who's sexual history you don't know. In general, alcohol and other drugs make things seem less risky and easier to do. Binge drinking, defined as having five or more drinks in one sitting, can cause a \"blackout,\" which means you won't remember anything that happened, even if you seemed like you knew what you were doing at the time. There are people who've had whole sexual interactions with someone only to forget and later find out from someone else that it happened. Imagine how that might feel. Not to mention, legally, no one, male or female, young or old, in a committed relationship or a one-time hookup, can consent to sex while under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs. Tell your partner you don't want to take the chance of hurting yourself or getting in trouble. If the relationship is healthy, your partner will respect your decision and not push the issue. If not, you may want to evaluate if the relationship is good for you.", "Anal Intercourse": "A sexual behavior where a penis or object is inserted into someone's anus for sexual pleasure.", "If both my partner and I have the same sexually transmitted disease (STD), is it OK to stop using condoms for sex?": "It might seem like since you and your partner both have the same STD that you could not infect each other. Unfortunately, this is not the case. A single STD (like HPV ) can have many different strains or types, so it's possible that you and your partner could infect each other with different types of the STD that you each have. Different infections in the same body can be harder to treat and can do more damage if untreated, so continuing to use condoms is a good idea.", "What can I expect during pregnancy? What will happen when it's time to give birth?": "We're glad you are asking us, but be sure to also ask your doctor or clinician for some books on pregnancy that he or she recommends. It's important to see a doctor or clinician as soon as possible. Getting prenatal care early in a pregnancy is one of the best ways to prevent health problems for you and your baby. Teen mothers are more likely than older mothers to face health complications such as giving birth prematurely and having babies who are very small. A lot of these complications come from having a poor diet, not beginning prenatal care early enough, not having regular checkups throughout the pregnancy or taking in substances such as alcohol or drugs. Your gynecologist or the prenatal clinic can help you put together a healthy diet and exercise plan and talk with you about other considerations you need to pay careful attention to because you're pregnant. Your clinician can give you a list of things to avoid and can prescribe prenatal vitamins. If you see any other doctors for other health problems, make sure they know you're pregnant. Some prescription medications and medical procedures are harmful if you are pregnant. During the nine months of pregnancy, your body changes as the fetus grows inside you. Check out the Mayo Clinic's site about what to expect throughout pregnancy. In the first weeks, you may feel few changes or you could feel really tired and nauseous. You might also notice that your breasts are swollen or sore. These symptoms are most common during the first trimester \u2014the first three months of pregnancy. During the second trimester, you'll start to gain more weight, but usually the fatigue and nausea go away. Because of that, many girls and women feel better during this part of the pregnancy. Others don't, and the fatigue and nausea continue throughout the pregnancy. You'll also notice a need to go to the bathroom more often. During the last trimester, especially the last few weeks, a lot of pregnant girls and women are uncomfortable, because they've gained much more weight and their expanded uterus puts pressure on other parts of their body, including their bladder, kidneys and lungs. Sometimes, they have trouble sleeping. Your body also starts preparing for the birth. Your muscles and ligaments will loosen up. You might feel off balance and like you're not in charge of your own body. You may also begin feeling contractions in your uterus. These are called \"Braxton-Hicks\" contractions that prepare the uterus for the work of pushing the baby out. They also help to slowly open your cervix. A fetus typically turns itself around, so it's in an upside down position. Babies usually come out head first, so the fetus turns to get in the \"birthing\" position. The fetus also usually drops (moves lower in the body) when it gets closer to delivery time. When you go into labor, these contractions will intensify and they'll start to hurt. Your water might break; this is when the sac that holds the amniotic fluid that has helped keep the fetus safe and growing the past nine months is done doing its job. Once this sac breaks, you will notice fluid or water released from the vagina. When your water breaks, delivery has to follow soon after, or else there is a risk of infection to both mother and baby. Giving birth is a natural process. Your body will do the work, without much help, in most cases. Bearing through the contractions is often the toughest part. Most hospitals offer birthing classes that you can take with the baby's father or another supportive person in your life. These classes explain the whole process and give you ways to cope with the pain. Be sure to talk to your health care provider about pain control options during delivery. One pain management option is called an \"epidural,\" which is an injection that basically numbs your pelvic area. Your doctor can talk to you about the pros and cons of this, as well as other types of pain management. Being in the delivery room to experience childbirth can also be an intense process for the baby's father or another person or people who are with you because they are important to you. Some young dads who have participated in the delivery say they experience intense connections and a sense of responsibility when they see and hold their newborn child for the first time. If the father and mother have a positive relationship, the mother may want to involve the father in the birth. These are just general guidelines. Everyone is different. Ask other people about their pregnancy or their partner's pregnancy. And again, be sure to ask your doctor or clinician, or check the local library for resources.", "HIV": "The human immunodeficiency virus is the virus that causes Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS ). The virus weakens a person's immune system so that the person can't fight off everyday infections.

When an adult is involved in any of these activities it is known as cyberharassment or cyberstalking.", "STD": "STD stands for sexually transmitted disease. Sexually transmitted diseases can also be called sexually transmitted infections (STIs). STDs are spread through sexual behavior or contact. Some STDs can be transmitted through skin-to-skin contact or body fluids such as blood, pre-cum, semen, vaginal fluids or breast milk. STDs generally infect the genital area (penis, scrotum, vulva and vaginal opening), anus or mouth, although they can spread to other parts of the body if left untreated.", "Rhythm Method": "The rhythm method is a behavioral form of birth control that calculates when a girl or woman is fertile during her monthly cycle so that she can abstain from sex during this period of time. Those who want to have a baby can also use this method to know when a woman is ovulating and therefore most likely to get pregnant. The rhythm method is actually made up of three separate methods: the tracking body temperature, charting the menstrual cycle and mucus methods. It is also called natural family planning or the fertility awareness method.", "Bartholin&#8217;s glands": "Two glands that are located in the inner labia on each side of the vaginal opening. Their purpose is to provide lubrication during sexual arousal.", "Sexuality Education": "Classes and workshops that teach about sexuality and sexual health. Sexuality education usually refers to classes that take place in a school rather than in a youth group or organization.", "Gonorrhea": "A sexually transmitted disease that is bacterial. Symptoms in guys include a pus-like discharge from the penis and an increased need to urinate. In girls and women, there may be discharge from the vagina. Many people will not have any symptoms. Gonorrhea can be treated and cured with antibiotics. Also referred to as &#8220;the clap&#8221; or &#8220;the drip.&#8221;", "Withdrawal": "A behavioral method of birth control that involves pulling a penis out of a vagina before ejaculation so that no sperm gets inside the vagina. Because it can be challenging to stop before ejaculating, and it does not provide any protection against STDs, it is not recommended as a reliable form of birth control. This method is also known as pulling-out or coitus interruptus.", "Genderqueer": "A way of describing one's gender that does not include the current terms of man, woman or transgender. Similar to how some people have taken back the negativity of the term queer because they don't feel the categories of sexual orientation describe accurately who they are, someone who identifies as \"genderqueer\" may not feel like the terms man, woman or transgender accurately reflect how they feel.", "My penis looks smaller compared to other guys I've seen in the locker room. Will my penis be too small to please a partner? I've heard you can buy things to make your penis bigger. Do they work?": "The size of your penis as a teen could change, because you're still growing. Penises come in different sizes and different shapes. Your penis will continue to grow until you've finished puberty. While there's a lot of talk about penis size, the truth penises come in different shapes and sizes. Some are a lot smaller when flaccid or limp. Some are longer and some are shorter; some are wide and some are thin. The thing is that everyone's penis is unique. If you looked at pictures of penises, you would find that penises are all very different, and there is no such thing as \"normal\" or the \"right way\" for a penis to look. Some guys will try anything to enlarge their penis. Save your money! Creams, pills and \"penis pumps\" might make your penis a little bigger for a little while, but the change won't last. In fact, penis pumps can actually damage the tissue and nerves in the penis, if used often. So a guy could end up being unable to get an erection or lose feeling in his penis. Don't believe those pictures you see either. They've been altered to make the penises look like they're really pumped up. A lot of guys grow up learning to measure their masculinity by the size of their penis because they believe penis size is important. For guys who are attracted to women: The truth is that the vagina is elastic. This means that the vagina can accommodate a big or a small penis. In fact, it can tightly accommodate something as small as a finger. Also, most of the nerve endings in the vagina are concentrated at the entrance. So, extra penis length won't necessarily do that much in terms of giving a woman pleasure. And the most important cluster of nerve endings for women are in the clitoris, and you don't need a penis to stimulate the clitoris. For guys who are attracted to guys, the truth is that giving pleasure to a man doesn't require a large penis either. If guys are having anal sex, a large penis isn't necessary to reach the \"male g-spot,\" the prostate. The prostate lies within a finger's reach inside the anus. In addition, some guys prefer oral sex or mutual masturbation to anal sex, and penis size really doesn't matter there either. But maybe most important\u2014sex isn't about competition (who's bigger, who's better); sex is about sharing, communicating, intimacy and pleasure. So the best partner is not the guy who has the biggest penis. The best partner is the guy who is best at communicating with his partner. He finds out what his partner's feelings are and shares his feelings. He learns how his partner likes to be touched (and what he or she doesn't like) and tells his partner what he likes and doesn't. It's not the size of your penis that makes you a \"real man\" or a good or bad partner; it's how you think and how you act.", "Gay Bashing": "This refers to the persecution of people who are or who are perceived to be gay, lesbian or bisexual. Bashing can include uttering threats, physical assault and battery, sexual assault and rape, torture, attempted murder and murder.", "Menstruation": "When the blood and tissue lining of the uterus sheds and comes out of the vagina, usually once every month.", "When does puberty happen and what changes?": "Girls Most girls start to go through puberty sometime between the ages of 9 and 13. Puberty is the process that changes the body from that of a child to that of an adult. On the outside of the body, \"breast budding\" is usually the first sign that girls have entered puberty. It can be scary and exciting all at the same time. Girls notice slight changes in the size and shape of their breasts as they begin to grow. Girls might also notice acne, body odor, sweat and hair growing in the armpits and around the vulva. Hair on the legs will become more evident. Girls may also grow wider hips and larger breasts, although the size and shape of both of these body parts will be different on different girls. All of these changes are the result of hormones\u2014chemicals in the body. Mood swings can also be a part of puberty. A girl might feel happy one second, sad and angry the next\u2014without being sure why she's feeling that way. This can seem like a roller coaster ride because a girl feels like she has no control. The good news is that these mood swings are part of the process, and both boys and girls go through them. If you know what to expect, sometimes it's easier to deal with them when they happen. Inside a girl's body, her uterus, cervix and ovaries are growing and maturing too. Sometime in the middle of puberty, girls usually get their first menstrual period. Guys When a guy starts going through puberty, the first thing that happens is growth of the testicles. In general, all of the other changes happen as a result of the increased testosterone, a hormone produced by the testicles. The first thing a guy usually notices is hair growing under his arms, around his penis area ( genitals ) and on his face. Hair on other parts of his body will often get thicker and darker too. Some guys have more hair than others. Genetics play a part in this. That means if your biological dad, for example, has a lot of body hair, you might have a lot of body hair, too. Guys may also notice acne, body odor or increased sweating. Like girls, guys will notice changes in mood. This is due to the changing hormone levels that take place during puberty. Also during puberty, a guy's voice box grows. That's what causes his voice to crack and squeak. It takes a little time for the cracking to stop, as the voice deepens and settles into its adult tone. The penis, testicles and scrotum also grow during puberty. The testicles will also start to produce sperm. Since your testicles are growing faster than your penis at first, it might seem like your penis is shrinking. It's not. During puberty, it's also common for boys to have large growth spurts, times when they grow fast over a short period of time. This rapid growth can cause \"growing pains,\" when joints and muscles ache and get sore. When a guy grows very fast, he doesn't have time to get used to his larger limbs, so he sometimes feels awkward and clumsy. Another thing that can happen to guys during puberty is getting an erection out of nowhere. It is perfectly normal for teen guys to get erections when they don't even feel turned on. They can happen without warning and at embarrassing times. Most teen guys who are going through puberty get spontaneous erections. They happen a lot less once a guy finishes puberty, although adult men still get spontaneous erections every once in a while.", "Hepatitis C": "A sexually transmitted disease caused by a virus that can cause liver damage. Infection occurs through contact with another person's infected blood, most often from sharing needles with someone who already has Hepatitis C. There are usually no symptoms associated with Hepatitis C. It is diagnosed through a blood test.", "What is the NuvaRing and how effective is it?": "The NuvaRing or \"the Ring\" is a flexible rubber ring that's inserted into the vagina for three weeks each month to prevent pregnancy. Hormones ( estrogen and progesterone ), which are concentrated in the Ring, are released into the reproductive system to prevent the body from releasing eggs (ovulating). A girl inserts the Ring into the vagina between the first and fifth day of her menstrual cycle. The Ring stays in the vagina for exactly three weeks, and then the girl removes it. Two to three days after it's removed, bleeding that's like a period will occur. Exactly seven days from when she removes the ring, she inserts a new one. This gives ongoing protection against pregnancy. The NuvaRing prevents pregnancy 99 percent of the time when used correctly every single month. It's fully effective seven days after it is first inserted into the vagina and then continuously after that. The NuvaRing does not protect against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), so backup method of birth control, such as a male and female condom, should be used. Some side effects include vaginal infections, irritation and discharge, headaches, weight gain or loss and nausea. A prescription is needed for the Ring, just like any other hormonal method of birth control. The cost varies depending on where the prescription is filled. Usually family planning clinics, like Planned Parenthood usually charge less than a private doctor's office. Insurance may also cover it.", "I really like someone, so how do I let him or her know?": "Lots of times people will ask how they can let someone know that they like them, without having to tell them. Or they will ask for advice on how to tell if someone likes them through signs or signals. The thing is, while it's really scary to tell someone \"I like you\" to his or her face or to ask this person if he or she likes you, asking is the best way to find out for sure how the person feels. The best thing to do is to talk to the person you like and say something like, \"I really enjoy talking with you, and I think we have a lot in common. I like you as more than just a friend, and I was wondering if you'd like to go on a date?\" This person may say no, but he or she may say yes. And although it can be really hard to put yourself out there, chances are the other person will respect you for being open and honest (instead of asking his or her best friend to find out if he or she likes you!). Plus, if you start a relationship with this person, open and honest communication is going to be important, so it's a good idea to practice good communication right from the beginning.", "Tribadism": "A sexual practice where two girls or women rub their genitals together for pleasure.", "Player": "A guy who has had or is perceived to have had many sexual partners.", "Transvestite": "A person who dresses in the clothing typically associated with a different gender. The preferred term for this tends to be \"crossdresser.\"", "Does having sex mean I'll fall in love?": "People who are in love sometimes decide to have sex, but having sex will not guarantee that you or your partner will fall in love. So, if you're using sex to fall in love, you very well might be disappointed. Sex means something different to everyone, and so does love. Sometimes, having sex makes you feel like you're in love, but it can be tricky. You think you're in love because of the way a person makes you feel physically\u2014not because of who he or she is and what you give to each other emotionally in everyday life. Sharing your body openly with someone else can often cause you to feel vulnerable. The truth is that couples who take their time to become friends before adding sexual behaviors to their relationship often become closer and more intimate on an emotional level, which can lead to more comfort on a sexual level.", "Horny": "A slang term for feeling sexually excited or turned on.", "Homophobia": "An irrational fear, hatred or prejudice toward people who are or who are perceived to be gay, lesbian or bisexual.", "Is HIV the same thing as AIDS? Do all people with AIDS die from it?": "The human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) is a viral infection that usually leads to acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ). When people are first infected with HIV, they often have no symptoms or very mild symptoms. Later, the virus weakens the immune system, allowing specific infections and diseases to occur. At this point, the person is diagnosed with AIDS. People with an AIDS diagnosis still have HIV in their bodies, and if they have unprotected sex or share needles, they can transmit the virus to someone else. Not all people with HIV develop AIDS. It's impossible to say how someone's body will respond to the infection, and there are different strains (kinds) of HIV. Most people with HIV, over time, get a weakened immune system that makes them more susceptible to infections and diseases that people with healthy immune systems typically don't get. People with HIV sometimes use medications to help build their immune system, decrease the amount of the virus in the body and to treat the different illnesses caused by HIV.

What is the clear fluid that comes out of a guy's penis before he ejaculates?": "Typically, about a teaspoon of semen is released when a guy ejaculates. If he ejaculates often, the amount usually decreases. That's normal since it takes about five to seven days for a guy to produce enough semen for a full ejaculation. If he ejaculates often, he would not have had time to build up the supply, so less will come out. There will always be some fluid with sperm released; remember, it only takes one sperm to fertilize an egg! The fluid that comes out before ejaculation is called pre-ejaculatory fluid or pre-cum, and it comes from the Cowper's gland inside a guy's reproductive system. It's released to clean out the inside of the urethra when a guy gets an erection. The urethra can have leftover urine in it from an earlier trip to the bathroom, and urine is acidic enough to be unfriendly to sperm. Pre-ejaculatory fluid makes the urethra less acidic and gives the sperm a better shot at surviving the trip through the urethra. Pre-ejaculatory fluid can contain sperm in some guys. Whether or not a guy's pre- ejaculate has sperm depends on the guy and every guy is different. Also, remember that pre-ejaculatory fluid can carry sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), so a guy should put on a condom as soon as he gets an erection.", "I need a prescription to get birth control. How can I get birth control, and how much does it cost? Will they tell my parents?": "To get some forms of birth control \u2014like the Pill, Depo-Provera (the Shot), NuvaRing (the Ring) and Ortho Evra (the Patch)\u2014you need a prescription from a doctor or clinician. Some health care providers prescribe hormonal birth control without a pelvic exam, but some require one. It varies from clinic to clinic. Be sure to ask your health care provider before your appointment if you are concerned about the pelvic exam. To get a prescription for birth control, you can visit either a gynecologist or a family planning clinic, like Planned Parenthood. Family planning clinics have programs specially designed to help young people get birth control, testing for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and pregnancy and other reproductive health care. These clinics usually offer their services at very low cost or for free for people who can't afford to pay. Clinics called Title X clinics have strict confidentiality policies, meaning they won't share your information or medical history with anyone, not even your parents. Private doctors' offices may have their own policies about confidentiality and whether they're willing to treat teens without a parent's consent. It's a good idea to call any clinic or doctor's office first and ask them about their policies. Clinic educators or counselors can talk to you about your birth control options, including everything from the Pill to condoms to Depo-Provera (a birth control shot that lasts three months). This is also one place you can go for emergency contraception (EC)\u2014which can prevent a pregnancy up to five days after unprotected vaginal sex. Find a confidential clinic in your area. For more information on the different birth control methods and how to get them, check out this FAQ .", "HIV/STD Education": "Classes or workshops during a school day or at community-based organizations that teach about how to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) from infecting individuals.", "Gender Neutral": "When the gender of a person or something that can be used by people is not specified or could apply to people of any gender. For example, the terms &#8220;spouse&#8221; and &#8220;partner&#8221; are gender-neutral alternatives to the gender-specific words &#8220;husband&#8221; and &#8220;wife.&#8221; Public restrooms that do not have the label \"men's room\" or \"women's room\" are gender neutral and can be used by a person of any gender.", "Testicle": "The gland in which sperm and the hormone testosterone are produced.

Am I normal?": "Your breasts, vulva or penis may not look like pictures you've seen, because every body is different. Bodies come in different shapes and sizes. And there is no such thing as the \"right way\" for breasts, vulvas or penises to look. Worries about your sexual parts\u2014breasts, vulva, penis\u2014can cause a lot of stress! A lot of people at one point in their lives have wondered if they are big enough or small enough or just right. Questions about breast and penis size are really common. It's a natural part of growing up to be curious about what to expect in terms of body changes.", "What is abuse and what does it mean to be \"abusive\"?": "Abuse is when one person hurts another person, either physically or emotionally. Abuse happens over time, usually in a cycle. It often continues until the person who is being abused gets help. Sometimes, someone else\u2014a friend, family member\u2014recognizes the abuse and jumps in to help. Many times, abuse can be hard to recognize and understand. One of the reasons is that an abusive person may not always seem abusive. An abusive person might seem like a nice person a lot of the time, and they might say that they care or are in love. Abuse rarely stops all by itself, but there are ways to get help if you think you are being abused. Different Types of Abuse Physical abuse is when someone physically hurts another person. Hitting, slapping, punching, kicking, burning, hair-pulling, choking and cutting are some examples of physical abuse. Physical abuse can leave bruises, burns and other physical marks. A lot of times, someone who is being physically abused will hide their wounds with clothes, sunglasses, make up or in other ways. Emotional abuse is when someone uses insults, criticisms and other hurtful words that make a person feel bad. People who are being emotionally abused might hear that they're fat, ugly, stupid or worthless or will never amount to anything. Emotional abuse can be done in private, but it can also be done in front of other people. Psychological abuse is the use of threats or other behaviors to scare someone and reduce their support system\u2014the people and resources someone relies on for help and support. People who psychologically abuse others do so in an attempt to make a person lose touch with reality so the person becomes dependent on the abuser. The abuser might threaten to punish or harm the person, someone they care about or themselves in order to get them to do what they want. Other examples of psychological abuse are stalking or preventing a person from sleeping. Sexual abuse is forcing someone to do something sexual against their will. Sexual abuse includes a lot of sexual behaviors\u2014everything from fondling a person's genitals and having sexual intercourse to forcing someone to watch porn or perform sex acts for money. Rape and incest are forms of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse can happen to both guys and girls. Financial abuse is when someone uses money to control another person. If one person has more money than the other person in a relationship, he or she may withhold money or control what that money can buy in order to control their partner. For teens, it might be that one of the partners has a job and because they always pay for everything, the partner with money uses that power to pressure the other person into things like sex. In the cycle of abuse, there can be a build-up of tension or stress before some kind of abusive incident happens. After the build-up, usually the abusive person does something abusive, whether it's physical, emotional, sexual or another type of abuse. Then it gets a little more confusing because there's usually a period of calm after the abuse. The abuser might apologize, swear it will never happen again or say that he or she will change. The abuser might bring the person who is being abused presents or be really nice to make up for the abuse. But usually the cycle just starts over again, and there will be more tension and more abuse. Exposure to any kind of abuse for a long time can damage a person's physical and emotional health. According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the majority of people who have experienced abuse from a partner are females, most frequently with males doing the abusing. But abuse can happen to people of all sexes. Abuse also happens in all types of relationships\u2014between partners of all sexes as well as between spouses, parent(s) and child(ren), and friends. Abuse can happen to people with little money and to people with lots of money. Abusive people can have college degrees or very little education. The same goes for people who are abused. Abuse can happen to people of all races, sexes, ethnicities, religions, socio-economic classes, abilities and sexual orientations. It doesn't really matter who the abuser or the abused is. Abuse is always wrong. Here's a list of \"red flags\" in a relationship. And for more examples of abuse, check out Teens Experiencing Abusive Relationships.", "I'm female, and sex is painful for me. What can I do?": "The most common cause of painful intercourse is too little vaginal lubrication. During sexual arousal, the walls of the vagina respond by releasing a liquid that wets or \"lubricates\" the vagina. This makes it easier for something to enter the vagina. Your partner may be trying to insert a penis or finger before you've had time to become excited enough to become lubricated or \" wet.\" If you're not excited when you start to have sex, the level of arousal may need to be higher for your body to get ready to have sex. Be sure you and your partner take your time. Don't leave out foreplay, and communicate with your partner about what feels good for both of you. If you are using a condom, dental dam or latex glove (we hope you are!), you may need to add lubrication. You can buy water-based lubricants at the store. Don't use petroleum jelly, types of massage oils, baby oil or lotion because oil-based products or products with oils in them cause latex to disintegrate and at the very least may weaken the condom, causing it to break. Another reason intercourse may be painful is if you are tense or worried. This can cause the vaginal entrance to tighten up so that inserting something feels painful. If you feel unsure about having sex or are worried about getting pregnant or a sexually transmitted disease ( STD ), this is a sign that it's probably not a good idea to have sex at this point or, at the very least, that you and your partner need to talk about how you feel about having sex and how to protect yourselves from both pregnancy and/or STDs. It is also important to talk to your gynecologist or health care provider if you are experiencing pain during intercourse. It is possible that you may have an infection or another medical condition. It's best to get it checked out. If you don't already have a regular gynecologist, find a clinic near you.", "Am I too young to fall in love? Is love the same as lust?": "There's no doubt that young teens and even pre-teens can feel that they're in love. It's definitely possible to feel attracted to and affectionate toward another person, even at a young age. No one but you can define the feelings that you have, be it love or something else. The capacity to love is something that all human beings, regardless of age, can experience. There are a lot of different kinds of love\u2014romantic, parental, platonic. Mostly, love is feeling emotionally attached to another person and having that feeling returned. You want to be close to and share things with that person. You want to understand him or her and have that person understand you. You want to care for him or her and have that person care for you. Romantic love usually comes with a strong physical or sexual attraction. You want to hold, touch and sometimes become sexual with that person. Lust tends to be physical attraction that may or may not be shared by the other person. Lust can sometimes turn into love. Often, when two people are first getting together, they have a really strong physical connection. When two people fall in love, a deeper, more intimate emotional connection forms. When you're falling in love, it's often tough to tell the difference between the two, especially if it's the first time you've experienced such intense emotions. This is where it can be helpful to talk to a trusted adult about these kinds of feelings. Ask this person what he or she thinks the difference is or how this person knew the difference when he or she felt each one. You don't necessarily have to talk about your own feelings to learn about other people's life experiences.", "Birth": "The process of a baby leaving the uterus. This can happen either through the vagina or through a caesarian section (C-section).", "Herpes": "A sexually transmitted disease that is caused by the Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV). It can also be transmitted non-sexually (such as through kissing) and causes small, blister-like sores (cold sores) around the mouth or genitals. Herpes type 1 is typically associated with sores around the mouth, while Herpes type 2 is typically associated with sores around the genitals or anus. Genital herpes cannot be cured, but the symptoms can be treated using antiviral medications.", "Can I end my own pregnancy by falling down the stairs or drinking an herbal tea?": "No, you can't end your own pregnancy by falling down the steps or using an herbal remedy. There are a lot of myths about how to end a pregnancy. It is impossible to tell which ones might work, which ones don't work and which ones can be very dangerous to your health and even your life. However, surgical and medical abortions are safe, effective and available in the U.S. You can find a clinic near you at Abortion Clinic Online. Women may attempt to end their own pregnancy because they are afraid to talk to someone and feel desperate. There is help for these kinds of feelings.

They can help.", "I have a smell and slight discharge coming out of my vagina. What is it, and is it normal?": "The vagina is a self-cleaning organ, and a slight discharge and scent is typical. Each day, the vagina produces some discharge that helps cleanse it by flushing out any harmful dirt or bacteria. Every girl has her own scent and every girl has vaginal discharge, which she might notice on her underwear or on toilet paper when she wipes after going to the bathroom. On some days, the discharge is white and pasty. On the days of the month when a girl is ovulating, it may be clear and stringy, kind of like egg whites. And on a few days each month, there may not be any discharge at all. It's helpful to know your vaginal scent so you can tell if something is different. If you notice your vaginal odor getting stronger or \"fishy,\" your discharge is greenish or grayish or you feel itching or soreness, you might have a yeast infection, bacterial infection or other type of problem, such as a sexually transmitted disease ( STD ). Some of these infections can happen in people who've never had sex. If you notice any of the symptoms listed above, see your health care provider.

It can be hard to find people who understand and are there for you. And school can be a scary place, especially for anyone who feels different or who is perceived to be different. Some people are bullied or physically threatened because they are transgender. The good news is that there are some steps you can take to feel safe and to find people who will stand by you. High school can be one of the hardest times to feel like you don't fit in. It is especially hard to feel like people don't understand you. It is important to remember that for many people the ticket out of a bad situation is a good education. If you feel it is not possible to obtain your education in safety, explore other ways to complete your education. There are many options such as taking college classes during the regular school day. Find out if your school or community has a queer / straight student group or gay -straight alliance ( GSA ). This might be a place to find some allies or, in other words, some people who have got your back. If not, find an adult you trust at school and consider starting a group yourself. There are lots of resources to help you at the Gay Lesbian Straight Education Network (GLSEN) and the GSA Network. This may not end the transphobia in your school right away, but having a network of people who support you and care about you is important. Consider whether and when to talk to your friends. Think about caring adults you know (family, friends, teachers, a school counselor, a doctor) who may already be in your life, and who might be good advocates. Consider talking with teachers and administrators about small changes that can be made (like teacher training or safer bathrooms and locker rooms) that would make a big difference.

The vagina produces its own lubrication naturally, but there are also manufactured lubricants that can be used. Examples of these include AstroGlide, K-Y Jelly and Slippery Stuff. All are water-based and safe to use with latex condoms. Oil-based lubricants should never be used with latex, as it will cause the latex to break down and increase the risk of pregnancy or the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.", "What is a hymen?": "The hymen is a thin membrane that partially covers the vaginal opening. Hymens can be thick or thin and come in different shapes. It is typical for the hymen to shed a little blood if it tears for the first time. Some girls break or tear their hymen when they are playing sports, riding a bicycle, masturbating or during sexual activity with a partner such as fingering or vaginal sex with a penis. If the hymen is very thick, a girl may have a difficult time inserting a tampon, penis or finger into her vagina. She can talk to her health care provider if these activities are painful.", "Testicular Exam": "There are two types of testicular exams: one done by a health care provider and a testicular self-exam which a boy or man can do on himself, or have his partner do for him. During a testicular exam, a health care provider visually and manually checks the scrotum\u2014the loose bag of skin which holds the testes\u2014and penis for lumps or growths on the skin. The purpose of a testicular exam is to have a male familiarize himself with his body, so if there are lumps, bumps or warts, he can have them checked out by his health care provider. Some medical professionals recommend that guys perform monthly testicular self-exams. Early detection is the best way to improve the chances of survival if the abnormality is found to be cancerous. Learn how to perform a testicular self-exam.", "Chicken Head": "A derogatory term for a girl that \"frequently\" performs oral sex on a male.", "Are girls the only ones who worry about their body image?": "No. Although there's a lot more information for girls about body image, boys also experience similar pressures and worries about their bodies. The messages given to girls and boys (based on stereotypes about what males and females \"should\" look like) are different, too. Girls get the message that they should be super thin. Guys get the message that they should be big with bulging muscles. That often leads guys to start lifting weights at a young age. When you start lifting weights before age 14 or 15 (as a general rule), the heavy exercise can damage muscles, tendons and bones that are still growing. That can lead to permanent damage. Guys sometimes even take steroids, drugs that can make them larger and stronger. But these drugs are harmful and illegal. Even steroid-type supplements sold in health food stores can cause health problems. Guys also worry about their hair, skin, penis size and the way they look in general, but they may feel discouraged from talking about their feelings. Those who feel insecure about their bodies should talk to a parent or other trusted adult, like a teacher, relative, doctor or clergy person, for example. They can connect you with counselors or support groups that can help.", "Platonic": "A term to describe relationship that does not include romance or sex; a non-sexual friendship.", "What is cybersex or phone sex? How do you do it? Is it safe?": "Cyber and phone sex usually involve sex talk on the phone or texting on the phone or messaging over the Internet. Sometimes, one or both people masturbate as they talk about sexually arousing things. For some people, cyber and phone sex are ways to have sexual experiences with another person without the risks of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Couples who are separated by distance sometimes use phone or cybersex to stay close while they're apart. Other times, people in committed relationships use phone or cybersex to have sexual activity outside of their relationship that they don't see as cheating. Some people do consider this kind of sex cheating. It's up to each couple to decide what is OK and what's not OK in their relationship. Cyber and phone sex have no risk of pregnancy or STD, since you aren't in physical contact with the other person. They can carry emotional risks and privacy risks, though. If you exchange phone numbers, screen names or addresses with people you don't know or only know over the Internet, it can be dangerous since you don't know who you're talking to. That's especially true with cybersex when people can lie easily about their age, sex and who they are. Sexual predators (usually adults) sometimes disguise themselves and go online to lure young people into sexual encounters, pornography, prostitution and other illegal and dangerous activities. That's why it's important to never arrange a personal meeting with someone you only know through the Internet. People have been hurt and even killed by agreeing to meet with people they only know online. This sounds extreme, and certainly doesn't happen often, but it's something to be aware of so you can make the best decisions for you.", "Sometimes I can't get or keep an erection. Why? Can I use Viagra?": "A lot of guys don't want to admit it, but not being able to get or keep an erection happens more often than you'd think. Guys usually have trouble getting or keeping an erection when they're nervous, scared or worried about something. They might be worried about how they'll \"perform,\" or they could be feeling guilty about having sex. They might be afraid of getting a sexually transmitted disease ( STD ), or, if they are with a girl, getting their partner pregnant. Drugs (including some anti-depressants) and alcohol can also prevent you from getting and/or maintaining an erection. If you can keep an erection when you're alone, then you're probably worried about something when you're with your partner. Think about how you feel and then talk to your partner about your concerns. You might be putting too much pressure on yourself or not protecting yourself by using condoms and birth control. Or maybe you'll discover that you're really not ready for sex right now and need to wait until it feels right. Since you're a teen and therefore young to have this happen, you should get checked by your doctor or clinician to see whether anything physical is going on. Remember that our brain is the most powerful sex organ we have\u2014so something as minor as stress can affect your ability to get and keep an erection. And remember, the idea that you can ejaculate and get another erection right away is a myth for most guys. Usually, you have to wait a while. The time between ejaculating and being able to get another erection is called the refractory period. It can last minutes or hours depending on a guy's age and health. Viagra is a medication that is prescribed to people with certain medical conditions. You should never take medication if it hasn't been prescribed to you, no matter what it is. Viagra should not be used recreationally. Some teenage and adult males who have abused Viagra have ended up in the emergency room. It's just not worth it.", "Mutual Masturbation": "When partners either touch their own genitals while they are together, or touch each others' genitals at the same time for sexual pleasure.", "Will the adoptive parents pay my expenses? How do I know that the adoptive parents will take good care of my child?": "Most states have laws that detail the types of expenses an adoptive family can pay. The most common are maternity-related medical and hospital costs such as: Temporary living expenses of the mother during pregnancy Counseling fees Legal fees Travel costs, meals and lodging when necessary In order to prevent people from \"buying\" babies, states usually limit these payments to \"reasonable\" amounts. About 20 states outlaw payment for certain expenses such as cars, vacations or permanent housing. When working with a licensed child adoption agency, prospective adoptive parents must be carefully screened and give a lot of personal information before they can be approved to adopt a child. Social workers visit their homes several times. Adoptive parents provide personal references and they usually undergo a background check. They also learn about becoming an adoptive parent before the adoption. By the time an agency has approved adoptive parents, they have gotten to know them well and feel confident they'll make good parents. The adoption process varies from state to state and the private adoption process is different than the agency process. To find out about the laws concerning private adoptions in your state, you can do a search on the Child Welfare site.", "Fingering": "A slang term for using one or several fingers to touch a girl's or woman's genitals, usually including a combination of touching or rubbing the clitoris and placing fingers inside of her vagina.", "Pornography": "Books, magazines, movies and videos about sexually-related topics that are designed to cause arousal in the people who read or view them.

In a boy's or man's body, the gonads are the testes which is where sperm are made. On a girl or woman, these are called ovaries, which is where eggs are made.", "Hormonal method": "A method of birth control that prevents ovulation (the release of an egg from an ovary ).", "Do I need to use protection during oral sex?": "Yes. Although the chance of getting or giving a sexually transmitted disease ( STD ) during oral sex is less likely than with vaginal or anal sex it is still possible. Many STDs can be passed from the mouth to genitals and vice versa. STDs, including chlamydia, gonorrhea, HPV, herpes, hepatitis B and syphilis, can be spread by giving or receiving oral sex. There is a small risk for getting and giving HIV through oral sex, too. Anytime pre-ejaculatory fluid, semen or vaginal fluids enter the body, whether through the mouth or another opening, there's a risk of transmitting an STD if either partner has one. HPV and herpes are not spread through fluids\u2014they are spread through skin to skin contact. It's tough to tell whether a person has an infection. Sometimes, people have infections and don't even know it. This doesn't mean that you can't enjoy oral sex. But it does mean that you need to plan ahead, talk to your partner and use protection. One way to make oral sex safer is to get tested for STDs regularly. Pay attention to any potential symptoms of STDs, and get them checked out by a health care provider right away. If you do not abstain from oral sex, using a latex barrier or other safer sex method is your best chance of avoiding most STDs. A condom can be used on a penis to protect a guy and his partner from STDs. Many condom brands have flavored condoms to make using one during oral sex more enjoyable. A dental dam \u2014a thin sheet of latex\u2014can be used for oral sex on a vagina or anus. You can get dental dams at a clinic. Sexual partners can also cut a condom lengthwise to create a sheet that works like a dental dam to use as a barrier between a person's mouth and a vulva or anus.", "What are the different kinds of birth control? How do they work and how effective are they?": "Birth control refers to something that is used to prevent pregnancy. There are so many methods available! They all fall into one of four different categories: hormonal, barrier, behavioral or spermicidal. Below, we explain what these different methods are, how they work and how effective they are\u2014when used correctly and consistently\u2014at preventing pregnancy. When birth control fails, it's usually because it wasn't used properly. Human error (\"Oops, I forgot my Pill!\") is a huge factor in whether birth control works or not. This is why manufacturers of drugs actually note two different rates of effectiveness for each birth control method. One rate is with \"perfect use,\" and the other is the \"typical use\" rate. Keep in mind that the effectiveness rates represent the number of couples who do not get pregnant out of a hundred. For example, condoms are 98-percent effective with perfect use, which means that if 100 couples correctly use condoms every time they have sex, 98 couples don't get pregnant and two do. Barrier Methods Barrier methods (such as condoms or diaphragms) create a physical barrier between sperm and the egg. Condom These latex or polyurethane sheaths cover the penis and prevent bodily fluids from transferring from one person to another. Condoms are effective in preventing pregnancy and the transmission of STDs. Effectiveness Perfect use: 98 % Typical use: 87 % How It Works The condom fits right over an erect penis and should be put on before engaging in any type of sexual intercourse. This creates a barrier so no bodily fluids are exchanged between partners. This means sperm can't enter a vagina to cause a pregnancy, if the couple is male-female. It also means partners are less likely to be at risk of getting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Keep in Mind Condoms are really effective at protecting against pregnancy and most STDs when they're used correctly. They are also cheap, easy to obtain and use and come in a variety of sizes, shapes and textures and flavors for oral sex. Use water-based lubricant when engaging in vaginal or anal sex. Female Condom The female condom\u2014also known as an internal or receptive condom\u2014is a polyurethane or nitrile sheath with flexible rings at the ends that help the condom stay in place. Effectiveness Perfect use: 95 % Typical use: 79 % How It Works The female condom is inserted into the vagina and held in by a ring that covers the cervix. On the other end is another ring that stays outside of the vagina, partly covering the labia. Like the male condom, this creates a barrier that prevents the exchange of bodily fluids that could cause STDs or pregnancy. Keep in Mind Female condoms can be a bit tricky to insert, but anyone can get the hang of it with some practice. The female condom gets some major points because it can be inserted up to 8 hours before sex. Cervical Cap The cervical cap is a small latex, plastic or silicone rubber cup that covers the cervix\u2014the lower part of the uterus \u2014and prevents sperm from entering the uterus. Spermicide can be placed on the inside and outside of the cap. Effectiveness Perfect use: 91 % Typical use: 86 % How It Works The cervical cap fits over the cervix\u2014the lower part of the uterus\u2014and keeps sperm from entering the uterus. Keep in Mind You have to visit a clinic or see a health care provider to be fitted for a cervical cap. Like diaphragms, cervical caps are most effective when used with spermicide. They are also reusable and must be washed and stored in a dry container. Cervical caps do not provide protection from STDs. Diaphragm The diaphragm is a thin rubber or silicone dome with a springy, flexible rim that is held in place by the muscles in the vagina. It must be used with spermicides and should be inserted before engaging in any sexual behaviors. After intercourse, the diaphragm must be left in place for at least six hours to be effective. Effectiveness Perfect use: 94 % Typical use: 88 % How It Works The diaphragm works as a barrier that covers the cervix\u2014the lower part of the uterus\u2014 and keeps sperm from entering the uterus. Keep in Mind Women have to visit a clinic or see a health care provider to be fitted for a diaphragm. They are most effective when used with spermicide. Diaphragms are reusable; they must be washed and stored in a dry container. They do not provide protection from STDs. Today Sponge The Today Sponge is a single-use polyurethane sponge that contains spermicide. The sponge has a loop for easy removal. Effectiveness Perfect use: 80-91 % Typical Use: 76-88 % How It Works The Today Sponge fits over the cervix\u2014the lower part of the uterus\u2014and keeps sperm from entering the uterus, while the spermicide kills sperm. Keep in Mind The Today Sponge can be bought in drugstores. It must stay in place at least six hours after vaginal sex to be effective. The Today Sponge is not reusable and does not provide protection against STDs. Hormonal Methods Hormonal methods (such as the Pill, the Patch and the Ring) use hormones to prevent ovulation and thicken cervical mucus, creating a barrier that can prevent sperm from entering the uterus. Without an egg, pregnancy can't happen. Hormonal methods of birth control are more than 99-percent effective. But that's only if they're used correctly and consistently. Birth Control Pill (the Pill) Often referred to as simply \"the Pill,\" this hormonal birth control method is a pill taken at the same time each day. Effectiveness Perfect Use: 99.7 % Typical Use: 93 % How It Works The Pill works by releasing synthetic hormones similar to estrogen and progesterone. The Pill stops ovulation so no eggs are released. It also thickens cervical mucus to make it difficult for sperm to enter the uterus. Keep in Mind The Pill requires a prescription and a visit to a health care provider. The Pill must be taken every day at the same time. When taken with some drugs, such as antibiotics, the effectiveness may be lowered. The Pill does not provide protection against STDs. The Shot Depo-Provera is a shot that injects hormones into the body to prevent pregnancy for three months. Effectiveness Perfect Use: 99.8 % Typical Use: 94 % How It Works The Depo-Provera shot injects high levels of progestin, a synthetic hormone similar to progesterone, into the body. This stops the ovaries from releasing eggs, thickens the cervical mucus and changes the lining of the uterus. Depo-Provera users get an injection (shot) once every three months in their upper arm or upper buttocks/lower back. Keep in Mind The Shot requires a prescription and a visit to a health care provider. It is effective after 24 hours and requires no daily attention. The Shot does not provide protection against STDs. Implanon This flexible rod is inserted into the body through a small incision in the upper arm. The rod is must be inserted by a healthcare provider and is about 1.5 inches long. Effectiveness Perfect use: 99.95 % Typical use: 99.95 % How It Works Implanon is another device that releases progestin in order to prevent ovulation and thicken the cervical mucus. Keep in Mind Implanon requires no attention for up to three years. It has to be inserted by a health care professional and requires an incision in the arm. Implanon does not provide protection against STDs. NuvaRing (the Ring) This small, soft, clear, flexible ring is inserted into the vagina once a month for three weeks with one week being ring-free when withdrawal bleeding similar to a period takes place. Effectiveness Perfect use: 99.7 % Typical use: 92 % How It Works NuvaRing releases synthetic hormones similar to estrogen and progesterone, which prevents ovulation and thickens the cervical mucus. Keep in Mind The Ring only requires attention monthly, but it may be difficult to insert the ring until a girl or woman gets the hang of it. The Ring does not provide protection against STDs. The Patch Often referred to simply as \"the Patch,\" this thin, beige, smooth patch looks like an over-sized Band-Aid and is worn on a girl's or woman's buttocks, lower back, abdomen or upper arm. Effectiveness Perfect use: 99.7 % Typical use: 91 % How It Works The Patch releases synthetic hormones through the skin to prevent ovulation. After the girl or woman places the Patch on her skin, and it remains in place for one week. She replaces it once a week for three weeks in a row. On the fourth week, she removes the patch so that withdrawal bleeding similar to a period can take place. The next week, she applies a new patch and the cycle repeats. Keep in Mind The Patch does not provide protection against STDs. The Patch also delivers more hormones into the body than the Pill does. This can mean that girls and women who should not take estrogen-based products should not use the Patch. Talk with your health care provider to find out more. Behavioral Methods Behavioral methods (such as abstaining from sex or using the withdrawal method) are ways that people change their sexual behavior and patterns in order to attempt to prevent pregnancy. Abstinence The only completely safe sex is no sex\u2014including vaginal, oral and anal sex. Effectiveness: 100 % How It Works No intercourse whatsoever. Keep in Mind Resisting natural sexual urges can make it difficult to remain abstinent. For abstinence to be 100-percent effective, it requires that you not have any type of intercourse, including vaginal, oral and anal sex. When abstinence is used properly it prevents any risk of pregnancy or STDs. Coitus Interruptus (The Withdrawal Method or Pulling Out ) The withdrawal method. Pulling out. Call it what you like, it's all about getting the penis out of the vagina and away from the vulva before ejaculation. Effectiveness Perfect use: 96 % Typical use: 80 % How It Works This method works by removing the penis from the vagina before the male ejaculates so that sperm cannot enter the female's body. Keep in Mind It is a better form of birth control than none at all. It is always available when needed, but it is not very reliable. Many younger men may not be able to totally control their ejaculation and so run the risk of ejaculating too early or too close to the vulva. The withdrawal method offers zero protection against STDs. Spermicidal Methods Spermicides are chemicals that kill sperm. They come in a variety of forms including gel, cream, foam, suppositories and film, which can be purchased in most drugstores or grocery stores and don't require a prescription. They are meant to be used as a back-up method with one of the other methods, such as a condom. Spermicides When Used Alone Effectiveness Perfect use: 82 % Typical use: 72 % How It Works Spermicides work by killing sperm and keeping them from joining with an egg. They come in many types\u2014creams, films, foams, gels, and suppositories. A girl or woman lies down or squats, then gently inserts the spermicide deep into her vagina using her fingers or an applicator. Keep in Mind For most spermicides, a girl or woman will need to wait 10-15 minutes after inserting the spermicide before having vaginal intercourse. This allows time for the spermicide to dissolve. Spermicide typically remains effective for only one hour after insertion, and more spermicide must be inserted each time a girl or woman has vaginal intercourse. Spermicides can also cause irritation. Some people are allergic to them. Spermicides do not provide protection against STDs. Keep in mind that 85 percent of sexually active, heterosexual couples who do not use ANY method of birth control will become pregnant within a year. If you don't want to get pregnant, it's important to use birth control, correctly and consistently\u2014this means every time.", "Vaginal Intercourse": "When a penis, sex toy or dildo is inserted into a vagina.", "Vagina": "The passageway from the uterus to the outside of a girl's or woman&#8217;s body. This is how menstrual blood, vaginal fluids and babies leave the body. It is also where a penis would be inserted during penile-vaginal intercourse, a finger or object for sexual pleasure or a tampon during menstruation.", "Endometrium": "The lining of the uterus that grows and sheds during the menstrual cycle. It is also where a fertilized egg implants to begin a pregnancy.", "Is it OK to have sex with a friend?": "Some teens might experiment sexually with friends to practice and learn about sex or to have sex outside of the context of a romantic relationship. Friends sometimes have sex because they feel more comfortable and already have a level of emotional closeness with each other. Sometimes problems occur when two friends have different expectations of the relationship after they have sex. One person might think having sex moves the relationship into the \" love \" category while the other one wants to keep things just as they were. If that happens, someone is sure to get hurt. As with any sexual decision, it's important to talk about having sex before you do it. Make sure you both want the same things and are ready to handle the outcomes and responsibilities that come with having sex. This includes protecting yourselves from an unplanned pregnancy and/or sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and discussing how you'll feel if sex brings about feelings that you didn't expect.", "What is the Today Sponge?": "The Today Sponge (which is often just called \"the sponge\") is a hormone -free birth control method that does not require a prescription. The sponge acts like a barrier to prevent sperm from swimming into a girl's cervix , and the spermicide on the sponge kills sperm. It is a soft, white sponge with a small indentation on both sides. The sponge is pre-soaked in spermicide, which is activated by water. It has a polyester loop attached, so it can be removed easily. To use the sponge, a girl runs it under a light stream of water, and then squishes it between her fingers until it gets sudsy. She then folds it in half and inserts it deep into the vagina until it rests against the cervix. The sponge can be inserted into the vagina for up to 24 hours and must be left in place for at least six hours after intercourse. If it is not, sperm can still enter her cervix and fertilize an egg if one is present. The Today Sponge is effective between 80 to 91 percent of the time, if used perfectly. With typical use it is 76- to 88-percent effective. If a couple uses a condom plus the sponge, they would be able to protect themselves from sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and unplanned pregnancy at a very high effectiveness rate. Today Sponge Pros: Easy to use. Doesn't require a doctor's visit or prescription. Available in stores. Provides an option for couples who don't want to use hormonal contraception. Used only when a girl actually has vaginal intercourse. Today Sponge Cons: Not as effective as hormonal contraception. Provides no protection from STDs. Can be expensive if needed regularly (each sponge costs about three dollars). May be uncomfortable or difficult to use if she doesn't like to touch her own vulva and vagina. To get more detailed information about the sponge, check out the official website. For information on other birth control methods, check out this FAQ.", "Spermicide": "A chemical that kills sperm. The most common spermicide is nonoxynol-9. It comes in a variety of forms including gel, cream, foam, suppositories and film which can be purchased in most drug or grocery stores without a prescription.

You can also purchase condoms lubricated with spermicide.", "Camel Toe": "A slang term that refers to the visible indent between the labia, which is sometimes seen when a woman wears tighter clothing.", "Bulimia": "An eating disorder in which a person eats large amounts of food in a short period of time, and then vomits or uses laxatives to purge, or get rid of, what they've eaten.", "Breasts": "A set of glands on a female's chest; breasts can produce milk after a woman gives birth. Males also have breasts, but they do not produce milk.", "I've heard chlamydia and gonorrhea are curable with antibiotics, so what's the big deal if I get it?": "Chlamydia and gonorrhea are common, curable infections caused by bacteria. But, just because they are common and curable doesn't mean they aren't a big deal. The thing with chlamydia and gonorrhea is that they often have no symptoms in guys or girls, so it is often impossible to know if you have them, or if your sexual partner has them, unless you are both tested. They can be transmitted through vaginal, anal and\u2014although less likely\u2014 oral sex . When guys get these bacterial infections, if they have symptoms, it hurts when they pee. They may experience swelling of the testicles or discharge from the penis. Girls can have pain when they pee and an unusual discharge from the vagina. While not as common, it is possible to get chlamydia or gonorrhea in the throat, if you give oral sex to an infected person. It's also possible to get it in the anus or rectum through anal sex. Both chlamydia and gonorrhea can be cured with antibiotics. However, a person can transmit them to a partner until they have finished taking all of their antibiotics. And, even if you've been treated and cured of chlamydia or gonorrhea once, you can still get it again if you have sexual contact with an infected partner. If left untreated, they can cause severe infections in the reproductive system and can even cause sterility in guys and infertility in girls, meaning they'll be unable to have children down the road. A health care provider tests for chlamydia or gonorrhea in the anus or genitals, by swabbing the anus, cervix or urethra (in a male). Health care providers can also do urine tests and look for traces of discharge in the urine. The best way to avoid chlamydia and gonorrhea\u2014and any STD \u2014is to always use a condom and other safer sex methods when you have sex and to get tested with a partner before having any kind of sex. If you're sexually active, it's recommended you get tested for gonorrhea each year, just to be safe and sure. Most clinics and hospitals offer free or low-cost STD testing. Find a clinic near you or locate a Planned Parenthood near you by calling 1-800-230-PLAN (7526) . Have more questions? You can learn more at the website for the American Sexual Health Association.", "I'm going out with someone who's much older than me. What is the big deal?": "We can all have attractions to people in our lives, sometimes regardless of age. However, you can be attracted to someone and not act on that feeling. These feelings can help you learn about yourself and what you're looking for in a partner, without getting into a situation that you're not ready for. There can be a big difference in maturity levels and life experience between two people, especially when there is a big difference in age. Because of this, it can get tricky when a teen wants to become involved with someone who is much older than he or she is. Without realizing it, there is an imbalance of power in the relationship. Because older partners tend to have more experience, and possibly more freedom, this can give them an unfair advantage over younger teens that have less experience and freedom. This can affect things like where you hang out, who drives and what you do sexually. It can also place pressure on the younger partner to try things they're not ready for, simply because the older partner makes it seem like it's no big deal. Problems also crop up if the older person\u2014who can be male or female\u2014stops you from hanging out with friends your own age or doing things at school. This can get in the way of the normal process of growing from a teen to an adult. If you are having sex in your relationship, check the laws in your state. Depending on your ages, your partner could be breaking the law. In all but two states, it is illegal for anyone over 18\u2014male or female\u2014to have sex with someone under 16. These laws are meant to protect young people from being exploited by people who are older. It's a good idea to know the laws in your state.", "How do you kiss and what is French kissing?": "There is no \"correct\" way to kiss. A good kiss is different for everyone. Some like quick, dry kisses. Others like long, wet kisses. Some people prefer French kissing, when you open your mouth and use your tongue to explore your partner's mouth or when you both put your tongues in each other's mouths. Many people worry about whether they'll be a good kisser. But a good kiss is as much about being with the right partner as it is about technique.", "Menopause": "A stage in a woman&#8217;s life when her ovaries stop producing the hormone estrogen, and her body goes through a number of changes, including the end of her menstrual cycle. For most women this happens between the ages of 45 and 55.", "School Board": "A group of people in a particular community who are in charge of decision-making for local public schools in a school district. In some communities, they are appointed, in others they have to be elected. To find out more about your local school board, ask your principal or school secretary, or check out your school&#8217;s website.", "Wet Dream": "This is the release of semen from a boy or man's penis while he is sleeping, most commonly during puberty. This is also known as a nocturnal emission.", "Cervical Cancer": "A type of cancer that forms in tissues of the cervix. It is usually a slow-growing cancer that may not have symptoms, but can be found with a regular Pap test.", "What's the difference between a surgical abortion and a medical abortion? What are the risks of both types of abortion?": "There are two types of abortions: surgical and medical. Surgical abortions are the most common in the U.S. and use a procedure that removes the contents of the uterus. The process starts with a pelvic examination. Next, a shot of anesthesia, or pain killer, is applied to the cervix. Some choose general anesthesia, which basically means being put to sleep during the abortion. Once the anesthesia is applied, a tube is inserted into the cervix. The tube is used to remove the contents of the uterus with suction. The procedure takes five to 15 minutes. Cost ranges between $350 and $700, depending on where you go and how long you have been pregnant. Sometimes, for surgical abortions, a procedure called dilation and curettage (D&amp;C) is also used. Later in pregnancy, another type of procedure called dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E) is used. Both D&amp;C and D&amp;E procedures remove what is inside of the uterus. Medical abortions, also called medication abortion or abortion by pill, are abortions performed with medicine. No surgery is used. They usually require two appointments with a clinician and they should be performed earlier in your pregnancy\u2014within the first nine weeks after your most recent period. On the first visit, the doctor will give you mifepristone (also known as RU-486 ). It works by preventing your body from producing progesterone, a hormone that is necessary for a pregnancy to continue. The clinician will instruct you when to take the second medication\u2014misoprostol. This causes the uterus to contract, which leads to a heavy period and a termination of the pregnancy. After taking both medications, it's important to return to the doctor's office once again to make sure the abortion is complete and there are no complications. Medical abortions are 95-percent effective and cost between $350 and $650, depending on where you live. Medical abortion is safe. It has been used in European countries for over a decade and is widely recommended by doctors. But there are risks with any medical procedure, including medical abortion. There are few harmful effects from abortions, as long as they are performed by trained clinicians. Early abortions do not increase the possibility of future miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies, birth defects or low infant birth weight. Even if a person has more than one early abortion, she will be able to get pregnant again and have children if she chooses to do so\u2014abortion has no effect on a person's future ability to conceive. Risks associated with abortion include the following: allergic reaction to the medication infection very heavy bleeding incomplete abortion undetected ectopic pregnancy in extremely rare cases, death, from very serious complications is possible It is medically safer to have an early surgical abortion within the first three months of pregnancy in the U.S. than to have your tonsils removed.", "Phone Sex": "A sexual encounter between two people that takes place entirely via the telephone.", "Contraceptive": "Any natural, barrier, hormonal or surgical method used to prevent pregnancy.", "What is the clitoris and what does it do? Is it the same as the G-spot?": "The clitoris is a small, sensitive organ located at the top of the vulva, just above the urethra and the vaginal opening. The function of the clitoris is to provide pleasure. Many women and girls enjoy touching, or having their partners touch their clitoris because this can be arousing and can also give them an orgasm. The G-spot is inside the vagina, on the front wall toward the front of the body and has a different texture than other areas inside the vagina. Some girls and women say that rubbing this spot gives them an orgasm. These orgasms sometimes result in ejaculation. That is, some girls spray a fluid out of the area near the urethra\u2014not urine \u2014during orgasm. Finding the G-spot can be tricky. When a finger is inserted into the vagina, think of the opening as a clock. Pressing toward the front side of the body, toward the pelvic bone, is 12:00 and pressing down toward the anus is 6:00. The G-spot on most females is at 12:00. It is only about an inch or two inside the entrance to the vagina, and the skin feels uneven. The tissue usually swells a little during intense stimulation. Since each person likes to be touched differently, talk with your partner about what exactly feels good, such as the place being touched and the amount of pressure used. Most people would agree that communication is key to the healthiest sexual experiences. By the way, males have a \"male G-spot\": the prostate gland.", "What is Depo-Provera and how effective is it?": "Depo-Provera, also known as \"the Shot,\" is a hormonal method of birth control that contains one hormone : progesterone. This hormone stops ovulation (the release of an egg) and also causes thickening of the cervical mucus. Depo-Provera is ideal for girls who can't take estrogen or have trouble remembering to take the Pill every day on time. It's also a good choice for girls who take medicines that interfere with the effectiveness of the Pill, like antibiotics that are long-term. Depo-Provera users get an injection (shot) once every three months in their upper arm or upper buttocks/lower back. It's more than 99-percent effective at preventing pregnancy as long the shot is administered on time. The most common side effects are spotting and irregular bleeding, especially during the first few months of using the shot. Many girls eventually stop having periods; this is perfectly normal because the Shot also thins the lining of the uterus so there's nothing to shed each month. Some girls also report headaches, mood changes and weight gain. Depo-Provera does not protect against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), so using a condom or other back up method is a good idea. A prescription is needed to get the Shot, and the cost varies, depending on where you go. Usually, you'll pay less at a family planning clinic, like Planned Parenthood, than you will at a private doctor's office. Some insurance plans also cover Depo-Provera.", "Abortion": "A medical procedure that ends a pregnancy. There are two types of abortions: surgical and medical. Surgical abortions are the most common in the United States and utilize a procedure called vacuum aspiration. Medical abortions, also called drug-induced abortions, involve taking medication that terminates a pregnancy.", "Genital Warts": "A sexually transmitted disease caused by the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) that causes small, painless, flesh-colored bumps that often look like small cauliflowers around and in the genitals, anus and/or mouth.", "How does pregnancy happen?": "Pregnancy happens when an ovum, often called an egg (the female sex cell), has been fertilized by sperm (the male sex cell) and the zygote (the organism that results from the joining of an egg and a sperm) implants itself into the female's uterine lining. Semen is the white, sticky fluid that contains hundreds of millions of sperm that comes out when a guy ejaculates. When a guy and a girl have unprotected vaginal sex, semen is deposited into the vagina. The sperm swim through the cervix and uterus into the fallopian tubes. If the girl has recently ovulated (released an egg from one of her two ovaries), then the sperm can join with the egg. When the sperm and egg join, it is called fertilization. Pregnancy can also happen by alternative fertilization, where a health care provider inserts semen into the vagina through a process called in vitro fertilization (IVF). Girls usually release an egg about once a month through a process called ovulation. An egg can be fertilized for 24 to 36 hours. Sperm, on the other hand, can live for five to seven days inside the female reproductive system. That means a couple can have intercourse on Saturday, the female could ovulate on Wednesday, and the sperm could fertilize the egg on Thursday. Once the sperm fertilizes the egg, a zygote is formed. This is a cluster of cells that continues to divide as it travels along the fallopian tube. After five days, it is referred to as a blastocyst. When it reaches the uterus, there is a lining of blood and other tissue in the uterus that has been developing in case an egg is fertilized. The blastocyst attaches to this nutrient-rich lining and literally dumps its genetic material into the lining. This process is called implantation. Once that happens, she is medically pregnant. After implantation, the mass of cells is referred to as an embryo, and later, after a couple of weeks, it is referred to as a fetus. If sperm are deposited into a girl's reproductive system but no egg is present, or if an egg is present but sperm don't fertilize it (sometimes this happens), then the egg dies and the lining of the uterus sheds. A girl getting a period is the shedding of this lining.", "Cervical Os": "The opening of the cervix.", "Anonymous Testing": "A type of reporting used when providing HIV test results to the health department. Anonymous testing means that test results are reported to the health department by using a code, not a person's real name.", "Gardasil": "A vaccine for people ages nine to 26 that helps prevent four strains of human papillomavirus (HPV). These four types of HPV account for 70 percent of cervical cancer cases, and cause 90 percent of cases of genital warts. HPV can lead to cancer of the genitals for guys too, but it's very rare. Guys can get genital warts on or around their genitals (including the anus).The vaccine protects them from contracting the virus and therefore stops the spread of certain strains of HPV to their partners. The Gardasil vaccine is given in three injections over six months. It's most effective BEFORE a person starts having sex, but has benefits even if that person has had sex in the past. Gardasil may not fully protect everyone and does not prevent all types of cervical cancer, so it is important for girls and women to continue to see their gynecologist or health care provider to get regular cervical cancer screenings, called Pap tests. Guys should also check with their health care provider if they notice any unusual lumps or growths on their genitals.", "Smegma": "A smelly, white, cheesy-looking substance that can accumulate around the genitals, particularly beneath foreskin of a boy or man is uncircumcised, or in the folds of the labia in a girl.

Can you help me?": "Being a teenager involves figuring out who you are, this includes developing a firmer sense of your sexual orientation and gender identity. It's normal for everyone, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, to question these things at some point in their lives. It can be stressful to realize you might be lesbian, gay or bisexual and/or transgender (LGBT). If you are lesbian, gay, bisexual and/or transgender, you should be able to celebrate, not feel stressed out about it! But we know that that's not always the case. What you need to know is that you are not alone. There are lots of lesbian, gay, bisexual and/or transgender teens out there and lots of teens who are questioning. So there are lots of places you can go to for support. Here are some great websites and hotlines to try: Youth Resource \u2014A website for gay, lesbian, bisexual and questioning youth.

When symptoms occur, they can include burning during urination, discharge and bleeding during intercourse for girls. For guys, pain during urination and a watery discharge are common symptoms. Chlamydia is the most common STD in the United States and is the leading cause of preventable infertility and ectopic pregnancy since it can cause scarring and damage to the female reproductive system if it is not treated early. Because chlamydia is a bacterial infection, it can be cured with antibiotics.", "I'm being abused. What can I do?": "First, know that you are not alone. Usually, children and teens are abused by people closest to them\u2014parents or guardians, other relatives, friends, neighbors, teachers and coaches\u2014the very people with whom children and teens should feel safest. This can make it hard to tell someone, but don't let it. Remember that no one has the right to abuse you. No one ever deserves to be abused, and it's not your fault. Sometimes abusers scare or threaten kids and teens so they won't tell; it's important to tell someone if you're being abused. Adults shouldn't ask kids to keep secrets. There are people who care about you and want to help. If you are being abused, you need to tell a trusted adult \u2014a relative, teacher, counselor, school nurse, neighbor, clergy member or parent. If the adult you tell doesn't do anything to get the abuse to stop, keep telling other trusted adults until someone does something to make it stop.

What's true and what's false?": "Below we separate fact from fiction. Myth : You can get pregnant from dry sex , or going through the motions of sex with clothes or underwear on. Truth : Overall, dry sex is a very safe sexual behavior that couples can do together. Whether there's a risk for pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) really depends on how much clothing the people are wearing. If a couple keeps their clothes on, the risk of pregnancy or disease is zero. Sperm, viruses and bacteria can't get through layers of fabric. Dry sex or body rubbing with no clothes on can be riskier. If a guy ejaculates on the vaginal opening, sperm can swim into her reproductive system and fertilize an egg if she recently ovulated. Also, some infections, such as herpes and HPV, can spread through skin-to-skin contact, even if the penis isn't inserted into the vagina. Myth : You can get pregnant from giving oral sex to a guy. Truth : This is not possible. In order for pregnancy to happen, semen has to get inside the vagina. From there, the sperm that are in the semen swim up through the cervix and uterus into the fallopian tubes. If someone swallows semen, the semen goes through a totally different body system. However, it is possible to get sexually transmitted diseases ( STD s ) by giving or receiving oral sex (regardless of a person's sex), including herpes. If you and your partner plan to have oral sex, the safest way is to use latex barriers, which even come in flavored varieties. It's also a really good idea for you and your partner to get tested for STDs before having oral, anal or vaginal sex. Myth : You can get pregnant if there is semen on a hand and it touches a girl's vaginal opening or is inserted into it. Truth : If someone has semen on his or her hand and then touches the vaginal opening, it is possible for a girl to get pregnant, though not very likely. The risk is very low. To potentially cause a pregnancy, the semen would still need to be wet on the hand because that is the only way sperm stay alive. Sperm also cannot live long outside of the body. The best way to prevent pregnancy is to wash your hands or even wipe them off so that your hands are dry. This way, pregnancy isn't possible. Myth : You can't get pregnant if you have sex in certain positions. Truth :This is a myth! It doesn't matter what position you're in. Any time semen is inside of or right outside of the vagina, a pregnancy is possible. To prevent pregnancy you must use a reliable method of birth control every time you have sex. Keep in mind that pregnancy isn't the only thing you have to be worried about. Besides condoms, the methods that work best to prevent pregnancy don't do anything to prevent STDs. So it's best to use condoms\u2014and, for really good protection, to use condoms and another method like the Pill or Shot. Myth : You can prevent pregnancy by douching after sex. Truth : Douching can't prevent pregnancy. In fact, it can actually increase the chances of a girl getting pregnant. Douching is when a girl uses a solution of water and some mild cleanser to wash out the inside of the vagina. The fluid is usually in a squeezable bottle with a long neck that can be inserted into the vagina and then the fluid is pushed up inside. If a girl or woman douches right after sex, the force of the douche liquid can push the semen further into a girl's body, increasing the chance of pregnancy. Myth : If you pee after sex you can't get pregnant. Truth : You can still get pregnant if you urinate (pee) after sex. Urinating after intercourse will not prevent pregnancy. Urine comes out of the urethra, which is a separate opening from the vagina. The urethra and the vagina are not connected. Since penile- vaginal intercourse happens when a penis is inserted into the vagina, urinating after sex doesn't prevent pregnancy. Myth : You can get pregnant if a guy cums in a pool or Jacuzzi while you're in it. Truth : No. If semen is ejaculated into a pool, hot tub, Jacuzzi or bathtub, the sperm will be diluted in the water or killed by the heat, soap or chemicals. There is no chance of pregnancy. But, if you have vaginal intercourse in a Jacuzzi, pool, hot tub or bathtub\u2014where the penis is in the vagina\u2014pregnancy is definitely possible. Sperm swim quickly up the vagina and the water can't get inside and wash it away. Myth : You can't get pregnant the first time you have sex. Truth : It's possible to get pregnant anytime you have vaginal sex, whether it's the first or the 100th time. Even if a girl has not gotten her period yet, it's possible that she's about to start having it, and if this is the case, she has ovulated. When an egg and sperm are present, pregnancy is possible.

How is it different than a cervical cap?": "Both the diaphragm and the cervical cap are rubber or silicone cups that fit inside the vagina and block the entrance to the cervix. They are barrier methods that prevent sperm from entering a girl or woman's reproductive system and fertilizing an egg if there is one present. Both methods are about 86- to 88-percent effective at preventing pregnancy with typical use. If used perfectly, they prevent pregnancy about 91 to 94 percent of the time. In general, the diaphragm is wider and provides a looser fit. The cervical cap provides a much tighter fit because it creates a suction seal around the cervix. Both come in different sizes because the size of a cervix differs for each woman. To get either, a girl needs to be fitted by a doctor or other health care provider. A prescription is also required for both methods. Cost varies depending on where it is fitted and purchased. To use a diaphragm or cervical cap, a girl puts spermicidal gel into the cup and around the edge and then inserts the diaphragm or cervical cap into the vagina before intercourse. The spermicidal gel provides a tight, sperm-killing barrier around the diaphragm or cervical cap. A diaphragm or cervical cap must be left in place for six to eight hours after intercourse. Having the diaphragm in for longer than 24 hours is not recommended, whereas the cervical cap can stay in for up to 48 hours before it is removed and cleaned. In the case of the diaphragm or the cervical cap, girls can get irritation just from having the cap or diaphragm inside them or they may experience pressure against their bladder. The other downside is that in certain sexual positions, the diaphragm and cervical cap can slip out of position, which increases the chance of getting pregnant. Neither method provides protection against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), so a condom or other back up method should also be used.

Both medical and surgical abortions cause some amount of cramping. These cramps can feel like light to heavy menstrual cramps, like when you get your period. Women who have had an abortion report cramps that last from five minutes to a half-hour. It is normal to experience some bleeding during and after either a medical or surgical abortion. You can use pads that are for periods. Most women find that an over-the-counter pain reliever is enough to help with their pain, and they are physically capable of returning to work or school after a surgical abortion. The clinic you choose will talk with you more about how you may feel physically and emotionally before, during and after the abortion. It is important to remember that each person has a unique experience of pain, so be sure to share any concerns you have with your health care provider.", "My partner is 17, and I'm 18. I have a naked picture my partner sent to me on my phone. My friend told me that if someone else sees it I can be charged with having child pornography. Is this true?": "Yes, what your friend told you is true. Naked pictures of people under the age of 18 are considered child pornography. When people hear the words \"child pornography,\" they may think of small children who cannot give permission to have their picture taken and might not understand what is happening. People may not think of someone who is 17 as a child. The reality is that, legally, the picture can be considered child pornography. There can be legal consequences for showing such a picture to someone else or for having possession of this kind of picture. The best thing to do is to delete the picture and talk with your partner about why you think taking and/or sharing nude photos might not be such a great idea anymore.

What should we consider? Any advice?": "There's some work and planning to do if you want to have a successful partnership. Bringing a child into a relationship can be difficult and can create a whole set of new challenges for you two to work on together. It's important for you to spend some time figuring out how you feel about the child's father. How would you define your relationship with him? Are you together as a couple? Are you just friends? Are you barely speaking? What kind of relationship would you like with him in the future? After you've had some time to yourself, it can be helpful to talk things through with a trusted adult in your life. Once you're more in touch with how you feel, have a conversation with him about what you've come up with. Talk about how having a child will change your lives. Is your relationship strong enough to survive the significant changes that come with a child? What does each person need to do to make the relationship more solid? Be honest with him about your relationship and your feelings. During this conversation, give him a chance to respond and to express how he's feeling, too. You do not necessarily need to make decisions during the conversation. You both might need time to think about it more after you've heard what the other person has to say. It's also important to discuss how and where you'll live\u2014separately or together, in an apartment, at one of your parent's homes or each at your own home. You may also find it helpful to divide responsibilities for caring for the baby. Will one of you stay home during the day? Or will you both work or go to school and have a relative or daycare provider care for your child? Basically, you're figuring out the best ways to start building this new life. Many towns offer programs for teen parents. They can teach you how to prepare for life with a baby. They might even have counseling services to help the two of you strengthen your relationship and parenting skills. If you decide that the romantic part of your relationship won't work, you still have a child to raise together. Some people call this \"co-parenting,\" which means sharing the various tasks of raising a child even though you're no longer a couple. Kids can benefit from caring and supportive relationships with adults in their lives, including both of their parents when possible. Establishing some ground rules with your co-parent can be helpful. For example, you might agree to establish some of the following rules: No arguing in front of the child. No bad-mouthing the other parent in front of the child.

What exactly is sexual harassment, and how can I make it stop?": "Sexual harassment is unwanted and unwelcome sexual attention (comments, looks, touching, rumors, etc.) that makes another person feel uncomfortable or prevents them from feeling safe in a place that they have to be, like school or work. Sexual harassment creates a \"hostile environment\" for the person who is experiencing it. With a hostile environment, it often becomes difficult for a person to be there. Someone talks about or writes about another person's body\u2014focusing on the sexual parts\u2014with others or in front of others. Someone spreads rumors on Facebook about someone's sexual orientation or things they've done sexually. Someone pinches or touches another person's butt or breasts as the person walks by. Someone keeps asking another person for dates or to hook up, even after that person has said no many times before. A group of people rates other people's attractiveness as they walk down the hallway. A teacher demands sex in exchange for a passing grade. A boss demands sex in exchange for a pay raise or different hours at a part- or full-time job. Sometimes, people will act surprised when they're told they are sexually harassing someone. But the person being harassed is the one who decides what feels like harassment. How to Make It Stop Most schools and work places now have policies against sexual harassment. Schools have a legal obligation to follow up on reports of sexual harassment so that the school is providing a safe environment in which to learn. The first thing you should do if you are being harassed is tell the harasser that their behavior is not wanted and to stop immediately. If that doesn't work, then take the following steps: 1. Tell an adult It can be a parent, teacher, coach, family friend or someone else you trust. An adult can help you get to other adults who can make the harassment stop. Schools and places where people work must follow up on harassment reports. 2. Find out what your school's sexual harassment policy is. Your school principal should have the policy in writing, and you are entitled to see it. Schools are legally obligated to respond when behavior violates their sexual harassment policy. 3. Keep records. Keep track\u2014on a computer or in a notebook\u2014of exactly what the person did. Include the date, time and place. Be sure to write down how you responded. This way you can show how long the harassment has been happening and how you've tried to make it stop. If the adult you tell doesn't do anything to make the harassment stop, keep telling other trusted adults until someone does something to make it stop. No one should have to put up with sexual harassment.", "I was just raped. I'm scared and don't know what to do. Can you help me?": "Here's what you should do immediately: 1. Get to someplace safe as soon as possible. 2. Once you're in a physically safe place, do not shower or bathe . This may be hard, because you may be feeling like you'd really like to wash off. However, showering or bathing also removes some evidence, which the police will need if you decide to press charges. You don't have to decide right away if you want to press charges, but the evidence needs to be collected now in case you decide to press charges in the future. 3. Call a local rape crisis center. 1-800-656-HOPE (4673) will connect you with the center in your area. A rape crisis center can help you seek medical assistance and assist you in getting other support. 4. Tell your parent(s) or guardian(s) or another adult in your life who you know well and trust. They can help you work through the next steps, including receiving medical attention and/or contacting the police. 5. Call the police or have the rape crisis counselor or your parent(s) or guardian(s) do it for you. They can let the police know what happened. The police will come and take a statement, and they will also let you know the options you have for pressing charges, whether now or in the future. They will help get you to a medical professional immediately. 6. Seek medical assistance. Rape crisis centers often provide someone to go with you to receive medical care in order to make the experience less scary and to help you through it. Medical professionals will: Examine you to make sure you weren't harmed internally or externally in any way. Give you medical care that may include emergency contraception (if you are a girl who was raped by a guy) and tests for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Collect evidence, so you have the option to press charges if you decide that feels right for you. It's important that you understand that what happened was not your fault. It was not your fault even if the person who raped you is someone you've been seeing for a while or is a relative or family friend. It was not your fault no matter how you were dressed or if you willingly started to do something sexual with this person and then changed your mind in the middle of it. In addition to taking care of your physical health, your emotional and psychological health is also really important. There is no one way that people respond or react to being raped or sexually assaulted, and there's no one right way to heal from that experience. It can be helpful to talk with people who are trained in working with sexual assault and rape survivors. It can also help to connect with others who have been through something similar to what you've been through. A great place to start is with the Rape, Abuse, &amp; Incest National Network ( RAINN ).

What is acquaintance rape?": "Sometimes people use the terms date rape and acquaintance rape interchangeably. Both mean that a person is raped by someone they know. Date rape is when someone you're dating, hooking up with or trying to get to know in a romantic way forces you to have sex without your consent. If you tell someone that you don't want to have sex or do not give consent and they force you, it's rape. It's rape even if you've had sex with that person before or started to have sex but then changed your mind. Acquaintance rape is when someone you are familiar with (a friend or coworker, for example) forces you to have sex against your will. Date and acquaintance rape can happen to males as well as females. The overwhelming majority of people who are raped\u2014 82 percent according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics\u2014know the person who raped them. Both date and acquaintance rape take advantage of the trust that someone places in another person because they are familiar with them.

If so, how can I know if my partner is infected?": "Yes, it's possible to have an STD and have no symptoms. This also means that your partner can have one and not know it. If symptoms do occur, they often do so in places that are difficult to see. For example, HIV \u2014the virus that causes AIDS, can live in the body for 10 years without a person showing any symptoms. HPV is perhaps the most common STD because it usually has no symptoms; people spread it without knowing they have it. Many STDs show no symptoms. Unfortunately, the long-term consequences of untreated STDs can be very harmful to your health. &nbsp;", "Crabs": "A slang term for \"pubic lice.\" An STD that is caused by a parasite. Pubic lice live in pubic hair and lay their eggs. They can cause intense itching, especially at night. Public lice can be sexually transmitted but can also be transmitted if people share towels or other linens. They are cured with anti-lice medicated shampoo and body wash, such as Kwell, which can be purchased in a drug store.", "I'm not involved in a relationship right now and like it that way. Is that OK?": "It is totally OK. There is a lot of pressure on teens to pair up romantically early on. Every person is different in terms of their comfort level. What's right for one person isn't necessarily a good fit for someone else. Lots of people aren't interested in relationships until their late teens or even their twenties. They have other interests that rank higher on their list of priorities. Maybe they're working hard at getting into a good college or really involved in a sport. Maybe they like being independent. While it may seem like everyone else is in a relationship, the truth of the matter is they're not. Do what's right for you and don't worry so much about what other people are doing or thinking.", "I just found out that I have a sexually transmitted disease (STD). Does this mean I should never have sex again? What do I tell my partner?": "No, it does not mean you should never have sex again. It does mean, however, that you should talk to any partners before engaging in sexual behaviors (oral, anal and vaginal sex ), about your status. If you end up testing positive for an STD, know that you are not alone. It can be helpful to get more information about it so you can know the facts before you talk to anyone else about it. Your health care provider, a family planning counselor or the person that tested you can often be a good person to talk to about any questions you have. Sometimes people need time to get used to the news themselves before they feel comfortable talking about it with another person. Some people get really nervous thinking about talking to a partner about an STD diagnosis. They might be afraid that their partner will be upset, dump them, say mean things to them or even go around telling other people. Even if you're nervous, it's really important to talk with your partner or partners about your diagnosis. If you have an STD, there is a chance that they have it, too. It's important for your partner to get tested, too. If only one person in a partnership is treated, you can get re-infected right away. Regardless of the kind of STD you have, practicing safer sex can help minimize the risk of transmitting it to a partner or getting re-infected. Talking with a partner about an STD diagnosis is something that is usually best done in a non-sexual situation. In other words, don't wait to mention it until you're in a sexual situation. You can let your partner know that you got tested and what the results are. It might help to have some information about the STD to share with your partner, including how to reduce the risk of transmission. Having all of the facts about the STD (how you get it, treatment, etc.) will make this conversation a lot easier. Safety is important. You're the expert on your own situation so you probably have an idea of whether it is safe to share this information with your partner. If you feel that you would be physically unsafe if you share your STD status with a partner, you may be able to get support doing so. Talk with your health care provider about whether they might be able to help inform partners that you tested positive for an STD. If you feel unsafe in your relationship, you can also get support from the National Teen Dating Abuse Hotline at 1-866-331-9474 or online at Loveisrespect.", "Birth Control Pills": "A hormonal method of birth control that prevents ovulation.

When it comes to what's best for you, it can be helpful to discuss various strategies with an adult who is close to you and who is trustworthy. There are a variety of options when it comes to getting support and help if you choose to stay in school: Can your parent(s) or guardian(s) or the baby's father's parent(s) or guardian(s) provide childcare while you're in school? Maybe they can split the job. If the baby's father is still in school, maybe his school provides childcare programs for teen parents. Your school may also have some kind of daycare program or programming for teen moms. If the baby's father isn't in school, perhaps he can get a job that allows him to take care of the baby while you're in school. It's possible to work on getting a high school equivalency diploma or to take classes at night. Some teen parents do not have these kinds of supports or options available to them and end up quitting school to stay home to take care of the baby. But you don't need to figure out all of this on your own. There are adults out there who want to see you succeed and want to help you reach your goals. School counselors are good resources to talk to when it comes to your options for continuing to build the kinds of skills that can be helpful in the work world.

A private doctor or a clinic (such as some Planned Parenthood health centers) are examples of abortion providers.", "I am taking medicine for my sexually transmitted disease (STD). Is it OK to have sex?": "You should always wait until you have finished all of your medication for any curable STD (such as chlamydia and gonorrhea ) and have had a follow-up examination before having sex with someone. Your sexual partner(s) should also complete treatment before you have sex again. Even if either of you had symptoms that went away, this does not mean that the infection is cured. Finishing all of your medicine and following up with your health care provider is the only way to be sure the infection is necessary to avoid passing the STD to another person. For viral STDs, such as herpes or HIV, taking some medications can help lower the risk of passing herpes or HIV to a partner, but there is still a chance you could infect a partner. Using condoms and other latex barriers during oral, anal or vaginal sex will help lower the chances even more. For example, certain medications used for treating herpes outbreaks can also help to reduce something called viral shedding. With herpes sometimes a person has symptoms\u2014such as blisters, itching or a tingling sensation\u2014when the virus can be \"shed\" (passed) to a partner, even though the shedding isn't accompanied by signs or symptoms. Certain medications can reduce this shedding significantly though a person can \"shed\" the virus without any symptoms. While there are no guarantees, taking these medications and also using condoms and other safer sex methods every time you have oral, anal or vaginal sex is a good way to help prevent passing the virus to your partner. Just keep in mind that condoms can't prevent infections from spreading if a person has an infection on the skin not covered by the condom. For example, if a person has a herpes sore on their upper thigh, then his or her partner could rub against it and also become infected with herpes.", "Dildo": "A penis-shaped sex toy often made of rubber or plastic.", "Sex": "1.

Sexual orientation refers to our inner sense of ourselves and to whom we're emotionally, romantically, physically and sexually attracted. People who are lesbian or gay are attracted to people of their same gender. This includes men who are attracted to men and women who are attracted to women. People who are bisexual people can feel attracted to people of more than one gender. The term queer can sometimes apply to someone who is lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. Some people call themselves queer, but not everyone feels comfortable with that term because it has sometimes been used as an insult against LGBTQ people. Transgender is different from lesbian, gay and bisexual. Though these terms are often grouped together under LGBTQ, transgender is actually a gender identity, not a sexual orientation. Gender identity is our innermost sense of whether we feel like we're a guy, a girl or someone else altogether. Our feelings about our gender identity often match up with the bodies we have. Someone who has a penis and testicles may close his eyes and think, \"Yep, I'm a guy!\" and someone who has a vagina and ovaries may close her eyes and think, \"Yep, I'm a girl!\" But sometimes our feelings and our bodies don't match. When our feelings about our gender doesn't match our body, that's called being transgender. Transgender people can be any sexual orientation, just like people who aren't transgender can be any sexual orientation. Some people are very sure about their sexual orientation and gender identity. They may know early on in their lives that they are heterosexual, gay, lesbian or bisexual. They may know clearly that they're a guy, a girl or that their feelings about their gender don't match their bodies.", "Dilation": "The process of widening an opening in the body. In reproductive health, it refers to the widening of the cervix during childbirth.", "I think I might be transgender. What&#8217;s going on?": "You're not alone. There are actually thousands of people in the U.S. (and millions worldwide) that were born with genitals from one sex but feel like their internal sense of gender doesn't line up. Some people who are born with a penis have a deep inner sense that says, \"But I'm really a girl!\" And some people are born with a vulva and have a deep inner sense that says, \"But I'm really a boy!\" They may become aware of these feelings as small children or later as adolescents or adults. Lots of people confuse being transgender with being lesbian, gay or bisexual. But they are different. Our sexual orientation is about who we're attracted to sexually and romantically. Being transgender has to do with our gender identity \u2014our sense of being a girl, a guy, neither or a little bit of both. For example, it's possible to be gay and transgender, and it's possible to be heterosexual and transgender. There are hundreds of words people use to describe their gender. Here are some examples: trans, transgender, transsexual, trans*, trans-warrior, male to female (M-to-F and MTF), female to male (F-to-M and FTM), cross-dresser, gender queer, differently gendered, female impersonator, queen, femme, femme queen and more. Like other transgender people, you may feel like you're the only one. Some transgender people may feel confused, or even sad or angry. Unfortunately, our society still has a long way to go in terms of understanding all of the different genders that exist. People who are transgender may express themselves in different ways. Some people who are born biologically male may just want to be able to wear women's clothing every once in a while. Others want to wear women's clothing all the time. Some people really feel like their biology contradicts who they are inside. Some may choose to take hormones and/or have surgery to change their bodies to match how they feel inside. If you are already taking hormones, it's important to do this with a health care provider. Hormones that people purchase \"on the street\" aren't regulated and may contain other ingredients besides what you need. Also, remember to use clean needles when using hormones since used needles transmit infections, such as HIV and hepatitis. There are inexpensive trans-friendly health clinics in most large cities where you can get safe supplies and good health care from trained professionals. Although it's also good to know that you may encounter a waiting list. To find a therapist who can understand what you are going through, if you live in a city with a LGBTQ health center you can contact them to see if they have a therapist on staff or to see if they have a therapist they can refer you to. If there is a community center for LGBTQ youth in your area, they may also have a list of LGBTQ friendly therapists, support groups or counselors. The Gay and Lesbian Medical Association maintains a list of LGBTQ friendly providers as well.

Is it the same as hermaphrodite?": "About one in a hundred people are born with biological differences that do not fit neatly into the typical definitions of male or female. These differences may be noticed at birth, or later on, or sometimes unexpectedly when the person has exams or tests for other medical reasons. Intersex is the term used to describe these biological differences. In the past, the word \"hermaphrodite\" was used to describe people who have sexual characteristics that are both male and female, but today many people prefer to use the word intersex. Hermaphrodite is considered offensive by some people. (Intersex is different from being transgender, bisexual, gay or lesbian.) An intersex person's anatomy is different than what society expects. A person might look female on the outside, but have mostly male organs on the inside. Or a person might have sex chromosomes that are different than expected. Intersex persons may have genitals that differ from what society expects. For instance, an intersex person might have a penis that is a lot smaller than usual. Or a clitoris that is a lot larger. Sometimes a person has a combination of both parts. Sometimes parents have children undergo surgery to bring their genitals into alignment with society's expectations. That means the parents and doctor must make a guess at what sex the child or infant would like to be. This is usually done before children can fully understand the implications of the surgery. In the past, families with intersex children were discouraged from talking about this at all. Intersex people have recently begun talking with each other about their experiences and speaking out about how they feel about these surgeries and about being intersex.

Where can I go to get a sexual health medical exam?": "Making an appointment with a reliable health care provider is a great way to determine what's healthy for you. If your regular health care provider is not experienced in providing adolescent gynecological or sexual health exams and counseling, you should find someone who is, such as an adolescent health specialist, a gynecologist or a nurse practitioner. This first visit may not include getting undressed for a pelvic exam or Pap test , but instead will involve a conversation with a caring health care professional about your sexual and reproductive health. You can search for a health care provider near you. When you first visit a health care provider\u2014including a gynecologist\u2014you will be asked to fill out a medical history form in the waiting room or in a private room. The clinician will then talk to you privately about your medical history. The medical history will include questions about your sexual history. Sometimes these questions can feel a little bit uncomfortable to answer, perhaps because they're not things that people generally discuss. It's important to answer each question completely and honestly so your health care provider can address everything that you need to stay healthy. Unlike girls, many guys don't go for regular medical checks of their sexual and reproductive organs, unless they have a problem. But it's a good idea for guys to see a doctor, get checked out and ask any questions before a problem arises. If you are having oral, vaginal or anal sex, then you need to get tested regularly for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). There are places that specialize in caring for teenagers. Outside of regular checkups, you should take a trip to a clinic or regular doctor if you have problems like genital rashes, discharges, unusual bumps or sores. Guys who have a lot of trouble getting or keeping an erection or ejaculating should also see a doctor or get a referral to a urologist if it happens more than half the time. You can see your regular doctor for most sexual health questions. If you don't feel comfortable talking to your doctor, you could also find a health clinic or a family planning clinic. When you go to a Title X clinic for health care services or counseling, your visit is totally confidential. Your records are not shared with anyone unless you ask them to do so. Title X clinics are teen-friendly, confidential and base their payments on a sliding-scale fee (which means you pay what you can). Planned Parenthood is one of many Title X clinics. You can find Title X clinics near you, or you can call 1-800-230-PLAN (7526) to be connected to the Planned Parenthood health center nearest you.", "Hooking Up": "A slang expression that can mean different things to different people. Generally refers to when two people are sexual with one another\u2014kissing, touching or having sexual intercourse.", "What if my partner doesn't want to use condoms?": "Many people use the motto: \" Safer sex or no sex !\" While this is not a bad way to look at using condoms, not everyone welcomes the use of condoms. In a perfect world, it would be easy to have an honest conversation about safer sex with your partner before you include sexual behaviors in your relationship. Talking about protection before sexual behavior becomes part of your relationship can give you an opportunity to get closer to your partner emotionally and can help the two of you decide whether you're on the same page when it comes to expectations about sex and protection. Unfortunately, many people find themselves trying to convince a partner to use a condom at the moment when they are feeling turned on, emotionally or physically vulnerable or even drunk. If you take the time beforehand to have this important conversation, then you can anticipate any potential problems and take steps to avoid situations where it will be hard to get what you need. For example, if you let your partner know that you want to use a condom, and he or she feels defensive about it, then you can take time to let him or her know that you want to use a condom because you care about him or her, your sex life together and the future of your relationship.", "Cervical Cap": "A small plastic or rubber cup that covers the cervix to prevent sperm from entering the uterus. Also known as a barrier method of birth control, it must be used with spermicide for maximum effectiveness.

It does not prevent sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).", "Is it rape if&#8230;?": "If someone forces (physically or otherwise) any kind of sexual activity on you\u2014after you've told that person no or were unable to tell that person no\u2014then it's rape or sexual assault. It's rape, even if\u2026> You know the person or are already in a relationship with the person. You have already had any kind of sex or done other sexual things with this person. You are fooling around with the person and either or both of you are turned on sexually. You started to do something sexual and then changed your mind because it hurt, didn't feel right, etc. You were asleep. You were drunk or high. You were passed out. The person has bought you gifts, taken you out to dinner or given you anything else. Here are some things to keep in mind: No means no. When you say no to any sexual suggestion or advance, the person should stop immediately. If something is happening that you don't want to happen, say, \"No,\" and, if possible, move physically away from the person. But, also remember, that not saying no isn't consent. Put another way, even if you don't say, \"No,\" that doesn't mean that you have consented. Only saying \"yes\" is giving consent, and if you do not feel comfortable saying \"no,\" then \"yes\" has no meaning. It is never the fault of the person who was raped, abused or assaulted. Sometimes, people will blame the victim for the abuse the victim has endured. Dressing a certain way does not mean that you \"asked for it,\" and it's not true that people can't control their sexual urges. There's no excuse for disrespecting another person's boundaries. Rape and assault are always the fault of the person who chose to violate another person. Everyone has choices. People make all kinds of choices. When people are getting sexually excited and one person wants to stop, the other has two choices: respect the person's wishes or keep pushing. Forcing another person into any kind of sex is sexual assault or rape, and it's against the law. You never have to do anything sexual you don't want to do. It doesn't matter how long you've been in a relationship with a person or how long you've known them. It doesn't matter if you've already had sex. It doesn't matter whether you're in the middle of something sexual already. If you don't want to do something sexually, you have the right to say no. If someone doesn't respect that limit, and forces you to engage in sexual behaviors then it's considered rape or sexual assault. If you or someone you know has been raped or sexually assaulted, tell someone and get help.

I've heard there's even a pill where you only get your period once a year. Is it OK to not get my period?": "Seasonale, Seasonique and LoSeasonique are the brand names of FDA -approved birth control pills that allow a woman or girl to only have four menstrual periods per year. Lybrel is the brand name of FDA-approved birth control pills that allow a woman or girl to only get her period once a year. Seasonal, Seasonique, Jolessa, Introvate and Lybrel are different from other birth control pills because women or girls who take them don't experience monthly periods or any of the common complaints associated with menstruation, like cramping and mood swings. How does it work? Like other forms of hormonal birth control, these birth control pills release hormones into a person's body that cause her not to ovulate. Since she is not releasing an egg ( ovum ), she cannot become pregnant. The hormones also cause her cervical mucus to thicken, which helps prevent sperm from reaching her uterus , cervix and fallopian tubes. With most birth control pills, there is a week of placebo pills at the end of each pack. Placebo pills contain no hormones and are included in the pack only to help her stay on schedule with taking a pill every day. With Seasonique, Seasonale and Lybrel, girls continue to take an \"active\" pill\u2014one that contains hormones\u2014each and every day so that the lining of the uterus never gets built-up or sheds. Thus, they do not get their periods. When taken correctly, all hormonal birth control has a failure rate of approximately one-percent per year. Taking any birth control pill consistent and correctly is the best way to ensure protection from an unintended pregnancy. What are the drawbacks? Some women and girls like getting their periods for a variety of reasons. Many use their period as confirmation that they aren't pregnant. Others just feel like it's an important part of being female. With pills like Seasonique, Seasonale or Lybrel, girls need to take a pregnancy test if they are experiencing common symptoms of pregnancy, like breast soreness or tenderness, having to urinate (pee) more often, feeling really tired, feeling nauseous and throwing up. Like with all hormonal birth control options, there are some side effects. The most common are unscheduled bleeding, headaches, nausea, vomiting, breast tenderness and difficulty wearing contact lenses due to dry eyes. These side effects, especially nausea and vomiting, may subside within the first three months of use. The serious side effects of these pills don't happen often, especially if you are in good health and do not smoke. Below are some examples of serious side effects: blood clots liver tumors high blood pressure And, of course, hormonal birth control pills don't provide any protection against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), so it is still important to use condoms even when on birth control pills. How do I get these pills? All hormonal birth control requires a prescription from a health care provider. Your doctor, gynecologist or a medical professional at a clinic can write one for you. They can also talk with you about all of your birth control options to make sure you are getting the right method for you.", "Seminiferous Tubules": "Highly coiled tubes in the testes where sperm is made.", "Placenta": "The sac in which a fetus develops during pregnancy that provides nourishment and protection.", "Erection": "An erection is when a penis fills with blood during sexual arousal and becomes hard.", "Meat": "A slang term for male genitals.", "Package": "A slang term for a boy or man's genitals.", "Can fingering or a hand job lead to pregnancy or an STD?": "There's almost no risk of pregnancy from fingering or hand jobs. If a person has dirty hands and touches another person's genitals, they can spread germs or bacteria. It's also possible, but not likely, to spread a sexually transmitted disease ( STD ) this way. And, there's a very small chance of starting a pregnancy if semen gets on one partner's finger and that finger is put immediately into the vagina.

Inside the scrotum are the testicles ( testes ), which are two small organs that are sometimes called \" balls.\" It is normal for the testicles to hang unevenly, with one lower than the other (usually the left!). This actually helps them avoid knocking into each other. (Ouch!) Sperm cells are made in the testicles, then stored in tubes nearby that are called the epididymis. Sperm need a specific temperature that is lower than body temperature to survive. Because of this, the testicles hang outside of the body in the scrotum, which regulates the testicular temperature. That's why when it's really warm, the scrotum relaxes and allows the testicles to hang lower, away from the warmth of the body, and when it's cold outside or when you're in cold water, the scrotum pulls the testicles close to the body to keep them warm. The sex hormone, testosterone, is also produced in the testicles. Testosterone helps give men their certain traits\u2014deeper voices, more hair on the body and an enhanced ability to build muscles.", "Where can I get an abortion, and how much do they cost?": "To find an abortion provider in your area call 1-800-772-9100 or check this directory. You can also look in the yellow pages under \" abortion \" or search online, but be careful. Some organizations actively try to convince you not to get an abortion. You can learn more about them here. Another way to find an honest, trustworthy clinic is to call your local Planned Parenthood at 1-800-230-PLAN (7526) or family planning clinic for a referral. The cost of an abortion depends mostly on how soon after you get pregnant you go for an abortion. Abortions performed earlier in a pregnancy \u2014during the first three months\u2014have fewer risks and cost less. Typically, a surgical abortion costs between $350 and $700 and a medical abortion cost between $350 and $650. Costs may be more or less depending on where you live. Some clinics offer sliding-fee scales, which means that you pay only what you can. Be sure to ask. If your family receives Medicaid \u2014health insurance for lower-income people\u2014it may pay for abortion services. It depends on the state you live in and the circumstances surrounding your pregnancy. Find out how your state works. Also, there are organizations such as the National Network for Abortion Funds that can help a girl or woman pay for an abortion if she can't afford it. If you have more questions about abortion, be sure to check our list of resources.", "What happens during menstruation (a period) and does it hurt? What products should I use during my period?": "The development of a menstrual cycle is part of puberty for girls. This cycle prepares a girl's body for pregnancy each month; if no pregnancy occurs during that cycle, hormones signal to the body to end the cycle. When the cycle ends, blood and other nutrients that have lined the uterus are released from the vaginal opening. This is called a menstruation or a period. For each menstrual cycle (which lasts about 28 days but can vary widely), an egg ( ovum ) matures and is released from one of a girl's two ovaries. The egg travels from the ovary, through a fallopian tube (there is one for each ovary) toward the uterus. As the egg travels, it sends hormonal signals to the body, telling it to develop a thick lining of blood and tissue inside the uterus. The job of this lining is to help the egg attach to the uterus, should it meet up with a sperm and become fertilized. If this happens, the fertilized egg latches onto the thick lining of tissue and blood, and a pregnancy begins. While a cycle can last about 28 days, each girl's cycle is different. A girl's period can come anywhere from every 21 days to every 34 days. When a girl first starts getting her period, it might skip a month or she may have a period earlier or later than she thought it would come. This is a normal part of growing into an adult. Eventually, a girl's cycle will stabilize, and it will be easier to know when to expect a period, though some girls are have irregular periods\u2014when their cycle can be a different number of days each month\u2014their whole lives. During the menstrual cycle, the uterus contracts to help push the blood and tissue from the body. These contractions can cause menstrual cramps a girl might feel during her period. They can be uncomfortable, but they don't happen for everyone. Cramps can be eased by taking over-the-counter medications, like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, which are available in drugstores and supermarkets. Stretching, sitting in a warm bath or using a heating pad on the abdomen or lower back can also help ease menstrual cramps. Exercise and eating healthy, especially before the period starts, can also help. It's uncommon for cramps to be so bad that a girl has to spend the day in bed, but if that were to happen, she could visit a doctor to find out what's going on. PMS Some girls feel cranky, tired, moody, bloated, achy and irritable the week before their period begins. This is called premenstrual syndrome (PMS). This happens because hormone changes in the body can affect all sorts of things, including mood, water retention and the sleep cycle. Some girls have little to no PMS. Others have a tough time functioning when it happens. If your PMS is very bad, talk to your health care provider about how you can manage it. Sanitary Pads and Tampons The most common menstrual products are sanitary pads or tampons, which are both available in drugstores and supermarkets. Pads come in a lot of different shapes and sizes\u2014maxi pads for heavy days, thin pads for light ones, pads for overnight and pads that are longer. They have sticky stuff (adhesive) on one side so they stick to your underwear. The other side is an absorbent material, sometimes covered by a thin mesh to help keep your skin dry. Tampons also come in various sizes\u2014like regular or super\u2014and are designed for different flows. They're inserted into the vagina and can be a good choice if you're going swimming, have a longer period of time where you can't use a bathroom or just don't want to wear a pad. Tampons must be changed every four to six hours to prevent the possibility of an illness called toxic shock syndrome (TSS). Wearing tampons (especially wearing the super absorbent kind when your flow is normal) for a long time can trap bacteria inside your vagina and can cause TSS. TSS symptoms include fever, nausea, vomiting, severe diarrhea, headache, dizziness, sore throat and a rash or peeling skin on your hands and feet. TSS is rare and can be treated with antibiotics if caught early enough. Menstrual Cups and Sponges Menstrual cups are inserted into the vagina and cover the cervix (the bottom end of the uterus). Menstrual blood collects in the cup, which can be worn up to 12 hours. When the cup needs to be changed, it's removed, washed and reinserted or replaced with a new one. Menstrual cups are sold under a variety of brand names, including Instead, the Diva Cup or The Keeper. Menstrual sponges or sea sponge tampons are made of natural sea sponge and are also inserted into the vagina, covering the cervix. Because they're sponges, they're very absorbent and can be changed less often than a tampon or pad. They can even be cleaned and re-inserted. Menstrual cups and sponges are much less commonly used than other methods and may take a little practice, just like any other method that's new to someone. Menstrual cups and sponges are also considered more environmentally friendly because they can be reused so there's no waste. Scented Menstrual Products and Douching It's a good idea to avoid scented menstrual products because they can irritate the vagina and just aren't necessary. It's also good to avoid douching, vaginal powders and sprays (both during your period and afterward) because they can also irritate the vagina. A period and natural vaginal fluids are perfect vaginal cleansers. Regular washing is enough to keep you clean!", "I've read on your website that I can't possibly be pregnant from what my partner and I did, but I'm still really anxious and worried that I might be. Can you help me?": "If you have learned that a particular behavior or situation cannot possibly cause pregnancy, such as dry sex, oral sex or touching of the genitals, and you are still concerned that you may be pregnant, then this may be a sign that you are not ready to be engaging in those particular sexual behaviors. Your feelings are a good indicator of what is right for you. Sexual behaviors should be enjoyable, pleasurable and/or create intimacy with a partner. They shouldn't cause anxiety around pregnancy if there is a low or no risk for pregnancy. You might want to think about what sexual behaviors you are ready to engage in, as well as what you are comfortable doing with a partner, and then talk about it with your partner. If you do not feel comfortable discussing this with your partner, think about why that is and decide if you're ready to be engaging in those particular sexual behaviors with your current partner. You may also want to talk to a trusted adult in your life about the anxiety you are feeling surrounding pregnancy. Trusted adults, such as parents, guardians, teachers, coaches, older siblings, health care providers, other family members or clergy people from your faith can be great to talk to because they can give good advice all while having your best interests at heart.", "How do I know if I have a healthy or unhealthy body image?": "Answer these questions and then read on to find out what your answers say about your body image. 1.

What do you think is too far? When answering these questions, look for extremes. If, for example, there is not one thing you like about your looks or you'd skip school because something didn't look right, you may have an unhealthy body image and may find it helpful to speak with a professional counselor to help work through any issues surrounding your body image.

It is easier to see on guys because the opening is visible at the end of the penis. A girl's urethra is usually hidden from view by her labia (vaginal lips). For guys, the urethra runs inside of the penis to the outside of the body and allows semen and urine to leave the body. When a guy gets an erection, a gland releases a clear fluid that comes out of the tip of the penis. At the same time, a valve shuts off the passageway between the bladder, where urine is stored, and the urethra. This makes it impossible for a guy to urinate and ejaculate at the same time. The clear fluid that comes out is called pre-ejaculatory fluid or pre-cum. This fluid cleans out the inside of the urethra. It makes the urethra less acidic and gives the sperm a better shot at surviving the trip from the testicles to the fallopian tubes (if the guy is having sex with a girl). Pre-ejaculatory fluid may contain sperm in some guys and it can carry sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in all, so a guy who's about to have intercourse should put on a condom as soon as he gets an erection.", "Alternative Fertilization": "A procedure that uses artificial means to place sperm into a female&#8217;s uterus or cervix.

Before an orgasm happens, a series of changes happen in the body\u2014things like increased heart rate, flushed skin and muscle tension. In addition, blood flow to the genitals increases. When an orgasm happens, the body releases all of this tension, resulting in a pleasurable feeling. Some people say orgasms feel like a slow build-up with an intense moment of excitement. Others say their entire body tingles. Everybody feels different. People often experience their first orgasm through masturbation. Each person needs different things to have an orgasm. It's important to tell a partner what feels good and what doesn't. If partners don't communicate about what feels good, how else will they know? It's also pretty uncommon for both people to have an orgasm at the same time, unlike what you might see in movies. When a male has an orgasm, it usually happens very close to an ejaculation. Most people need time to rest in between orgasms.

Is it possible to get an abortion after the first trimester?": "Abortion is a safe and legal option for teen and adult women in the U.S. until the end of the second trimester (or up to six months). Certain states have restrictions regarding when abortions can be performed and how though. You can find out more about the laws in your state here. It is really important for teen and adult women to seek an abortion as early in the pregnancy as possible. Why? Because most providers only perform abortions early in the pregnancy\u2014before 14 weeks. After that, abortion can be a more complicated and expensive medical procedure, and they may have to travel farther to find a provider to perform one. During the second trimester, a procedure that removes the contents of the uterus is used after 14 weeks of pregnancy. This procedure requires the cervix to be opened wider than for a first-trimester abortion. Some people get general anesthesia, which basically means being put to sleep during the procedure. Others get local anesthesia, which numbs the cervical area. Third-trimester abortions, which are done during the last three months of pregnancy, are very rare. Less than 1 percent of abortions are performed during the third trimester. They're usually done because of serious health problems with either the mother or the fetus. Third-trimester abortions are controversial, even among people who support abortion rights. That's because the fetus, at this point in a pregnancy, may be able to live outside the uterus on its own. While no one should feel rushed into making a decision about an unintended pregnancy, waiting until the third trimester\u2014or even the later part of the second trimester\u2014isn't a good idea because the procedure becomes more complicated.

Should I tell my friend, and if so, how?": "Falling in love or having a crush can be one of the best\u2014and worst\u2014feelings we can have as human beings. Sooner or later, a situation arises when we wonder what to do with our feelings. In this case, it is helpful to think about whether or not it is a good idea to want to date your best friend, regardless of gender. Ask yourself a few questions and carefully consider your answers. Are you confusing the intimacy of friendship with romantic feelings? Are you afraid to meet new people and seek relationships elsewhere? How will you feel if this friend doesn't feel the same way you feel? It can also help to review the pros and cons of talking to your friend about your feelings: Pros Your friend may feel the same way and hasn't had the courage to say anything yet. Revealing your feelings may begin a great romantic relationship. Your friend may say she or he doesn't feel attracted to you, but the trust you showed strengthens the friendship. Your friend may not be interested in being romantic with you, but you may feel relieved to get it off your chest. Cons Your friend may not have the same feelings, and you may feel heartbroken. Your friend may stop inviting you to do certain things because she or he worries about sending mixed messages. Your friend may be scared of your feelings, and ask to end your friendship. Your friend may betray your trust and tell other people, leaving you feeling exposed and vulnerable. Since you know your friend pretty well, you may have more pros and cons to add to these lists. Each friendship is different so the variables that influence the decision aren't always the same. One approach you may find useful is thinking about the best possible outcome, and also the worst. Are you willing to accept either as well as something else that you may not have considered? Which outcome, based on everything you know about your friendship and the person as an individual, do you think is most likely to happen? How would you feel if that was the outcome? Above all, keep in mind that you do have options. One option is to just keep your friend as a friend and seek romantic relationships with other people who you know are looking for a romantic relationship.", "What is a breast exam?": "A breast exam is when a girl's breasts are checked for any changes in the appearance or feel of the breasts. Gynecologists\u2014doctors who specialize in the care of women's and girls' reproductive health\u2014 and other health care providers perform breast exams during an appointment for overall sexual health. Girls should also get in the habit of performing their own breast self-exam each month (a week after each period is a good time), just to get familiar with their own breasts so that they will notice if something changes or feels different. When a breast exam is performed by your health care provider, you will go into an examination room, undress and put on a paper or cloth gown. A health care provider will come into the room for the exam. If you would prefer a clinician of a particular sex, you can request that ahead of time. Your health care provider will listen to your heart and lungs and may ask you to lie on your back for a breast exam. Some health care providers will teach you how to examine your own breasts and feel for any unusual lumps or swellings that might need medical care. Because it is common for girls' breasts to be lumpy during their teen years and into their early 20s, some gynecologists choose not to do a breast exam and say it's not necessary for younger teens to do breast self-exams. However, it's never too early to learn what is normal for your body. This makes it easier to recognize if something changes and might need to be checked out.", "What are wet dreams?": "A wet dream is the discharge of semen when a guy is sleeping. The technical name is \" nocturnal emission.\" Wet dreams can occur anytime, not just when guys first start producing sperm during puberty. Some guys get wet dreams, some don't. Wet dreams aren't necessarily associated with what you're dreaming about when they happen. They may have to do with a sexual dream that you remember or you may not remember what you were dreaming about at all. It's just the body's way of cleaning out semen that has built up. A guy who ejaculates on a regular basis\u2014either during sex or masturbating\u2014is less likely to have wet dreams. Wet dreams tend to slow down as guys get older, though even full-grown adults can have wet dreams.", "I have a crush on someone who's the same sex as me, and we fooled around. Am I lesbian, gay or bisexual?": "It's impossible for another person to know whether you're gay, lesbian or bisexual based on one \" crush \" or sexual behavior. During the teen years and young adulthood, many people struggle to discover who they are and that includes trying to figure out whether they're lesbian, gay, heterosexual or bisexual. At some point or another, almost everyone questions their sexual orientation ; it's part of determining who you are. Some people have sexual experiences with people of the same sex when they are young and that's perfectly OK. This is actually quite common. Also, many teens and adults have sexual thoughts or fantasies about people of the same sex without necessarily being gay, lesbian or bisexual. Sexual behaviors and fantasies don't determine orientation. Your feelings about other people, attractions and reactions to those feelings and attractions are what can help you define your orientation when you're ready. It can be very stressful to feel like you have to label yourself when you're really not sure. Give yourself time to figure out how you feel toward different people and in different situations. If your feelings continue to worry you, see a counselor or other professional who can help you sort things out.

Can I get an abortion without my parents knowing if I'm under 18?": "Many states have laws that require minors\u2014girls under 18\u2014to get a parent's permission before having an abortion. This is called parental consent. If a minor wants an abortion and doesn't want to involve her parents, and she lives in a state that requires parental permission for an abortion or parental notification that she is going to have an abortion, there is another option. She can go before a judge, and the judge can give permission instead of the parent(s) or guardian(s). This is called judicial bypass. The hotline run by the National Abortion Federation can be very help you learn about your rights: 1-800-772-9100 . Some states require teens to wait a certain period of time between making the decision to have an abortion and actually getting it. This is called a waiting period. To find out the laws in your state, go to Sexetc.org's Sex in the States or visit NARAL Pro-Choice America's website. If you decide to tell your parent(s) or guardian(s), find a time and place where you can talk privately with them. You can bring a friend or other adult along to support you if you think that might make it easier for you. Start by saying you have something very important to tell them. You can also say that it's taken a lot of courage for you to be honest with them. Then, just tell them. Parents or guardians of teenagers have a variety of reactions to news of a pregnancy. When you're ready to tell them, you may have had some time to adjust to the idea of pregnancy yourself. Your parent(s) or guardian(s) may need a similar adjustment period. In the end, the majority of parents or guardians want what is best for their child, and when it comes to a pregnancy, it's no different. Check out Mom, Dad, I'm Pregnant to get some more ideas about how to approach this conversation with your family. You know your parent(s) or guardian(s) and your situation the best, and while many girls will feel nervous or scared about having this conversation with their parent(s) or guardian(s), some may have a sense that it's not safe or doesn't feel right for them to talk to their immediate family. If you feel like it would be unsafe to talk about your pregnancy with your immediate family, it might help to talk with another trusted adult\u2014like a teacher, counselor, health care professional, community leader or relative\u2014about your situation. Sometimes having the support of another adult, either in person or just emotionally, can help assure that you stay safe.", "Do people choose to be trans?": "No, gender identity is just one piece of each individual's unique makeup, like eye color and height. Just as a person cannot choose which eye color he or she is born with, a person cannot choose to be transgender. For many people, their bodies at birth match their own internal sense of being female or male. For others, these things don't match. And for some it's more complicated. Think of the people you know whose internal sense of gender matches their body. Did they \"choose\" to be that way? The choice is not whether to be your gender or not\u2014but how to be who you are. There are some other things we do know. One can't be \"cured\" of being trans by doctors or counselors. Professionals can talk through things you may face as a trans person to make you feel more comfortable. They can also discuss your options if you'd like to take steps to make your body more physically like your gender identity. But there's not a treatment or pill that will actually change your gender identity. \"Pretending\" to be a different gender can't change one's gender identity, that is, one's core sense of who they are as a person.

How can they practice safer sex?": "People who identify as lesbian, gay, bi or heterosexual can give and express pleasure in many ways. There isn't just one way for two people to have sex, no matter what sex or sexual orientation they are. What two people of the same sex do to have sex together depends on what feels good for them. Often, people think that sex is only putting a penis into a vagina, but that may not be the activity that brings the most pleasure to the two people. This is true for heterosexual, bisexual, lesbian and gay people. Males who identify as gay, bisexual or just do sexual things with other males may use their fingers (manual stimulation), mouths ( oral sex ) and various body parts to give and receive pleasure. They may kiss, touch each other's bodies or touch the penis and other areas including the scrotum or the anus. Sometimes they use penises to penetrate the anal opening (anal sex). Females who identify as lesbian, bisexual or just do sexual things with other females may touch each other's genitals by using their fingers (manual stimulation), mouths (oral sex) and various body parts. They may kiss, touch each other's breasts or touch the clitoris and other areas of the vagina or the anus. Sometimes they use their fingers to penetrate the vaginal opening or to penetrate the anal opening (anal sex). Some also rub their vulvas together. It is possible to transmit sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) through many of these practices, so it is important for people who have partners of the same sex to read up on safer sex. It is important to use a condom for oral sex performed on a male and for anal sex, and to use a dental dam or a condom that is cut length-wise to create a sheet of latex to use as a barrier when performing oral-anal stimulation or oral sex on a female. When two people can communicate well, they can experience a wide range of sexual activities that are mutually agreed on, pleasurable and creative. This is true whether they are heterosexual, bisexual, lesbian or gay.", "Foreskin": "A retractable area of skin that covers and protects the head (glans) of the penis.

The health care provider inserts one or more fingers gently inside of the vagina and uses the other hand to feel the reproductive organs through the abdomen.", "How do you know if you're lesbian, gay, bisexual or heterosexual? Can you tell what someone's sexual orientation is just by looking at them?": "People determine their sexual orientation through their feelings of attraction and emotional closeness to others. At one point or another, almost everyone questions their orientation, even people who ultimately identify as heterosexual. For many people, this happens during the teen years since this is when people are defining themselves in a variety of areas of life. Many people who identify as lesbian, gay or bisexual report that they knew from a young age. Other people report a strong sense of being heterosexual, only to discover later in life that they identify as gay, lesbian or bisexual. Still others feel confused or don't choose to define themselves with one of these labels. Your orientation is yours to define and no one else's. Take your time. Don't push yourself to commit to an identity or label. Feel what you feel. You'll know when it's time to attach a name to your feelings. The only way to know how someone identifies in terms of their orientation is to ask them. Obviously, this wouldn't be appropriate if you didn't know the person. Each individual has the right to define their own identity, sexual or otherwise. Lots of times, we judge people based on stereotypes. So we might assume, for example, that a gay man is going to act feminine and a lesbian is going to act masculine. These are really examples of people not conforming to rigid gender expectations. Because of these stereotypes, teens who don't conform to their gender's stereotypes are often perceived to be gay or lesbian and face the same harassment as people who are.", "What happens the morning after? Will we get closer? Or will I feel like I just made a big mistake?": "The \"morning after\" usually refers to what happens after two people have sex. It usually depends on what happens the night before. If you and your partner have talked about the decision to have sex, your entire experience together will be something you can discuss and be open about. And if you practice safer sex (like condoms and/or birth control ), there's a better chance of feeling good about the experience after it happens because be able to worry less about sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and, if you are a heterosexual couple, an unplanned pregnancy. Sex won't automatically bring you closer. Knowing this, you'll probably feel better if you and your partner ask yourselves some important questions before making the decision to have sex, such as: Why do I want to have sex? What does having sex mean to me? Does having sex fit with my values ? Is this a one-time thing or do I see us having a relationship? If I see us in a relationship, what sort of relationship do I want? If you want different things\u2014one of you wants casual sex and the other wants a commitment, for example\u2014you may decide that sex isn't the best thing for you to share. It's also important to talk about other possible outcomes of having sex. These include pregnancy and/or sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including HIV. Some questions to ask yourselves include: What would you do if you or your partner became pregnant? How would you feel if you got an STD from your partner or your partner got one from you? If you are a heterosexual couple, you want to think about preventing pregnancy as well as STDs. If you're a lesbian or gay couple, you want to think about preventing STDs. Some questions to ask yourselves include: What kinds of protection do we need to use? Who will buy the protection we need? What will we do if it fails?

When they are formed, adhesions are easily treated by a health care professional.", "What should I consider if I'm thinking about abortion?": "Like all the pregnancy options, abortion is a very personal choice. Here's our list of things to take into consideration: It's a person's legal right to choose whether or not she gives birth, though in some states you need a parent's or judge's permission to have an abortion if you are under 18. Think about your moral, cultural and religious beliefs. What do you believe about abortion? How did you come to believe this? What have you been taught in your family or faith community about abortion? How do these messages fit with your own personal beliefs? No one should ever be pressured into having an abortion if she doesn't feel it's right for her, nor should she be shamed or pressured into choosing not to have an abortion if that's what she decides to do. Abortion is a safe and legal medical procedure. There are organizations such as the National Network for Abortion Funds that can help a girl or woman pay for an abortion if she can't afford it. There are also websites devoted to helping girls and women think through the abortion decision, such as PregnancyOptions.info, as well as hotlines, like Exhale, 1-866-4-EXHALE (39-4253), where you can call before and after the procedure to talk about it. Exhale's hotline is open Monday through Friday 5:00 to 10:00 p.m. Pacific time and Saturday and Sunday 12:00 to 10:00 p.m. Pacific time. You can also check out Backline or call them at 1-888-493-0092 . They are open Monday through Thursday 9:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. and Friday through Sunday 1:00 to 6:00 p.m. Eastern time. Whatever you choose, be sure you do it because it's the best choice for you. The sooner you get information about your options and start to consider them, the more options may be available to you because abortions become more complicated and more difficult to access later in pregnancy.

The outer lips are called the labia majora and the inner lips are called the labia minora.", "Menses": "Another word for a girl or woman's menstrual period.", "Does sex feel different with a condom?": "If you asked most people, they would say, \"Yes, it feels different with a condom \" \u2014but you'd get a range of descriptions. Some think it feels better, some think it feels worse. Some people say that sex feels better with condoms because they can relax and not worry about pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). And others like using condoms because different sensations can happen while using them. A common complaint about condoms is that they make it so that you \"can't feel anything.\" But some guys love using condoms because they can \"last longer\" or they like the sensations of ribbed condoms. Some girls and guys say that they feel distanced from their partners when they use condoms. But condoms protect you and your partner, so that can also make you feel closer. There are lots of brands and kinds of condoms out there. If you're worried about a different sensation or a condom ruining the experience, you might think about polyurethane condoms. Polyurethane conducts body heat better and can feel more \"sheer.\" You can also try thin latex condoms, such as Trojan UltraThin. You may also want to try putting a drop of water-based lubricant inside the condom at the tip so that it slides over the head of the penis more freely. If you are uncircumcised and experience pain when you put on the condom, you may have adhesions between your glans and shaft, which can be easily remedied at a doctor's office. If you are someone who experiences less pleasure when your partner uses a condom for oral, vaginal or anal sex, you can use a lubricant to help decrease friction between your skin and the condom. You can also make sure your partner is using a condom that fits well. There are different shapes and sizes of condoms, so read each label to find out what might work best for you and your partner. Flavored condoms can also be used for oral sex. And finally, even when it feels a little different when you use a condom, just remember that only condoms can protect you from most STDs, such as HIV. And for heterosexual couples, they also do \"double duty\" by backing up your birth control, like the Pill, Patch or Shot, to protect you from an unintended pregnancy.", "Beating the bishop": "A slang term for male masturbation.", "Medical Abortion": "When a pregnancy is ended by taking two medications rather than ended by a surgical procedure. First, a woman is given Mifepristone (a pill) or Methotrexate (an injection). The first medication works by inhibiting her body's ability to produce progesterone, a hormone that is necessary for sustaining a pregnancy. Three days later, another medication, Misoprostol, is given. This medication causes the muscles in a woman's uterus to contract and have her period. Medical abortions are 95-percent effective.", "Late-Term Abortion": "A term used to describe an abortion performed \"late\" in the pregnancy. However, experts do not agree about exactly when that is. For some, \"late\" abortions are those that take place after the 27th week of pregnancy; for others, the 21st week is considered \"late-term.\" Late-term abortions are legal, although states may have restrictions regarding them, but are relatively rare and harder to obtain than early abortions.", "My parent(s)/guardian(s) are very uptight about me starting to spend time with people I like romantically. How can I convince them I'm ready?": "While it may not be easy, the healthiest approach is to respect your parents' or guardians' wishes and, little by little, show them you're responsible enough to spend time with people that you're romantically interested in. That can mean helping around the house, doing well in school, being respectful, establishing trust and making good choices in all areas of your life to show maturity. It can also be useful to talk with your parents to understand where they're coming from. What are they worried about? What are they trying to protect you from? How can you help them trust you? Once you understand this, you can start to negotiate\u2014respectfully\u2014for a little more space. You can find ways to calm their fears\u2014maybe by spending time with people in groups, for example. Start small and work your way up. Once you earn their trust, your parents may reward you with more freedom. If your parents have strong religious beliefs or racial taboos about seeing people romantically, it can be a bit tougher to deal with. You might want to talk to another family member, school counselor or another trusted adult about how to approach your parents. In the end, going behind your parents' or guardians' backs will only decrease their trust in you and make it harder for you to gain the freedoms that you're looking for.", "Cesarean Section (C-Section)": "A surgical procedure that removes a baby from a woman&#8217;s uterus by cutting open her abdomen.", "I have a cold sore. Does that mean I have herpes?": "Cold sores are caused by a strain (or type) of the herpes simplex virus (HSV), so if you have cold sores (which are sometimes called fever blisters), you have herpes. But the type of herpes that can cause cold sores is often spread between people who have never had sex. In fact, most people get oral herpes from a relative or friend from a non-sexual kiss and a lot of people carry the virus, even if they never get the cold sores it causes. There are two types of herpes viruses\u2014oral and genital. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is the most common cause of oral herpes and herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) is the most common cause of genital herpes. HSV-1 and HSV-2 can both be transmitted from mouth to mouth, mouth to genitals, genitals to mouth and genitals to genitals. Herpes is also the only sexually transmitted disease ( STD ) that can be transmitted through kissing. Because it is possible to transmit herpes from the mouth to the genitals or the genitals to the mouth, using a condom or dental dam for oral sex can help to prevent the spread of herpes, but if a person has sores outside of the areas protected by the latex, exposure can still happen. For more information on herpes testing, treatment and support, visit the American Sexual Health Association 's website. There are medicines available to treat herpes, though there is no cure. &nbsp;", "Gang bang": "When a person is raped by multiple people at the same time.", "I'm being harassed because of my sexual orientation or gender identity. What is homophobia and transphobia, and how can I make the harassment stop?": "In a perfect world, people would accept each other for who they are. But the reality is that many people do not accept lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender ( LGBTQ ) people because they are not educated about it or are uncomfortable with something they're not used to. Unfortunately, this plays out in lots of places, including school. It can be called different things including harassment and bullying. Transphobia is the fear of and discrimination against transgender people and people thought to be transgender, regardless of their actual gender identity. Transphobia can lead to bias and even violence, which can make coming out as transgender even harder. Homophobia is the fear or dislike of people who are lesbian, gay or bisexual. When this fear and dislike is directed at bisexual people, it's called biphobia. Students who experience harassment in school often feel very isolated and are afraid to tell anyone what's happening. They may feel like they will be further harassed if they tell, or they may not want to tell people because it's embarrassing. Some students stop going to school because they think it's the only way to avoid the harassment. This can affect learning, grades and social relationships. This is why it's important to tell someone. It's never OK to harass another person. No one has the right to hurt another person, emotionally or physically. And no one should be discriminated against because of race, gender, age, physical abilities, sexual orientation or any other part of their identity. Here are some ways these phobias can have an impact on how people treat others: Calling a guy a \"fag\" Writing insults on the locker of a girl who the rumor mill says is bisexual Forcing a guy to have sex with a girl to prove he's not gay Raping a girl who identifies as lesbian to \"turn her\" heterosexual Stripping a transgender person to reveal that person's genitals and challenging their identity Hitting or hurting someone because she or he is gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender This type of behavior is always wrong. If you are being harassed, here are some steps you can take: 1. Find a teacher or administrator that you particularly trust or who has reached out to you in the past. Talk to him or her about how you are feeling, specifically what it feels like when students make homophobic or transphobic comments and when teachers don't say anything. If your teacher seems interested and asks how he or she can help, here are some suggestions: Ask the teacher to research the school's harassment policy and share it with the rest of the faculty. If the policy doesn't specifically include harassment based on perceived or actual orientation or gender identity, ask the teacher to consider advocating for an updated policy. You could get other students involved in this, too. Help organize a training for teachers on LGBTQ issues at school. Ask the speakers who come to the training to talk about homophobia, transphobia and the differences between sexual orientation, sexual identity, gender identity and what it means to be transgender. Ask him or her to talk to other teachers about the harassment taking place and their required role in responding to the harassment. Help start a gay- straight alliance ( GSA ) so that an entire team of students can change the climate at your school to be more aware of homophobia and transphobia. 2. Do some research. If your state school system has adopted \"Safe Schools\" laws, then this harassment must be stopped by the school administrators. Check out Sexetc.org's Sex in the States to review the laws in your state. Be sure to follow the link in the sources for updates. 3. Go straight to the top and talk to your principal. You could try to talk to him or her about this harassment or bullying and ask that it be addressed in a staff meeting with teachers. If you want to do some research on this topic before you talk to your principle, then try these websites: Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network and Lambda Legal. Think through all the adults you know who support you, pick one and tell them what's happening at school. Legally, it is the school's responsibility to create an environment where everyone can get an education and where no one is harassed.

Sperm can survive in the female reproductive system for five to seven days, and the egg is viable (able to be fertilized) for three days. If the two overlap, pregnancy is possible. It's really hard to figure out when those days are. This is because the three days the egg is viable can happen at different times each month. Remember that pregnancy isn't the only thing to consider. Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) can be transmitted during sex, and condoms are the only barrier against them. If you use condoms and a hormonal contraceptive method, like the Pill, every single time you have sex, you'll be protected against pregnancy and STDs every time.", "Parental Consent": "A law that requires young people under the age of 18 to get permission from one or both parents or another adult guardian before getting an abortion.

Generally, an STD test involves a blood sample, a urine sample or a culture, by a health care provider. When you see your doctor or health care provider, find out exactly what you are being tested for, so you know whether there are any tests missing. For example, a person is never automatically tested for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. If your doctor or health care provider doesn't mention it, you need to request this test specifically and give permission to have it done. There are home test kits for HIV and Hepatitis C available at some drugstores and online. You have to prick your finger and send the blood sample to a lab to be tested. You call the lab a few days later for results. They also provide anonymous counseling over the phone. One brand name is Home Access and currently costs around $45. However, we highly recommend going to a clinic for HIV testing. Just in case you test positive, it is much better to have some immediate support, like someone knowledgeable and caring who can talk to you about it. Also, a clinic can test you for all other STDs as well and provide things like free condoms.", "Guardian (Legal Guardian)": "A person who has the legal responsibility for providing care for a person who is a minor (a person under 18).", "Screwing": "A slang term for having vaginal intercourse.", "What is circumcision and does it affect sexual performance?": "Males are born with something called a foreskin, which is a sheath of skin that covers the head of the penis.

Some guys have not been circumcised and still have their foreskins. Basically, there's no difference between circumcised and uncircumcised penises, except for the way they look. They each function the same way.", "Vibrator": "A battery or electrically-powered device used to massage and provide stimulation to the body, especially the genitals.

It is 99-percent effective with perfect use at preventing pregnancy but does not protect against STDs.", "When I see actors, musicians or other celebrities on TV or in magazines, I always wonder, how do they look so good?": "Good question! The images we see on television and in magazines and movies send messages about what's beautiful and what makes someone successful. People often try to imitate those images, changing their clothes, haircut or style to be more like what they see in the media. The problem is, what's shown in the media doesn't usually represent reality. The media likes to show people who have rare body types\u2014people who are very skinny or very muscular, for example. But these kinds of body types are actually pretty unusual. Still, these images can make many teens feel like their body type is not good enough. When we don't look like these images, we may feel inferior or less successful. Our best defense is knowing that the media uses tricks, such as airbrushing or digital enhancement, to make people look \"better\" than they really do. Most of the pictures we see are distortions\u2014if not outright lies. And anyway, people come in all different shapes, sizes and colors. We are tall and short, thinner and heavier, lighter and darker. We have straight and curly hair. We have thin penises and thicker penises, small breasts and large breasts, lots of body hair and very little body hair. Every body type should be respected and celebrated. Remember: The media uses props, lighting and computer technology to make actors' and models' bodies look like the so-called \"perfect image.\" People's shapes and sizes are often changed in the pages of magazines. So-called \"imperfections\"\u2014 acne, freckles, lines, wrinkles, skin folds and other things\u2014are airbrushed out. Splicing together body parts from several different photographs can create the media's \"perfect image.\" So, what we often see in a magazine is a lie. Everyone is different. There is a lot of information available about the media and body image. Get media savvy. Don't let the media tell you how you should look or how you should feel about your body.", "Expiration Date": "The date found on a package that tells you when a product is no longer safe to use. In sexual health, this often refers to the date on a box of condoms that lets you know when it is not safe to continue using the condoms. So, if, for example, the expiration date reads 12/05/11, then you cannot use those condoms because the latex will begin to deteriorate after that date.", "What is anal sex, and how do you do it? Are there any risks?": "Anal sex is when a penis or other object is inserted into a partner's anus. Like any other sexual behavior, some people find it very pleasurable and others don't. Some people are curious about it, and others know it's not something they're comfortable with. There is nothing wrong with engaging in anal sex, but whether it is right for you is something only you can decide. Since the anus is not capable of producing its own lubrication (as the vagina can) and the tissue of the anus is very fragile, it is important that additional water-soluble lubrication (a variety of brands are available at drugstores) be used during anal sex. Without lubrication, there may be pain, discomfort and tearing of the tissue in the anus. During anal intercourse, as with any other type, comfort and relaxation are important for a pleasurable experience. When inserting a penis into the anus, go slowly and stop if there's pain or resistance. It's best if a person empties the bowels (poops) before anal intercourse and washes well before and after anal sex or oral-anal contact. Couples who engage in anal intercourse need to know that it is one of the ways that HIV can be spread sexually. This is because the lining of the anus is prone to tearing if there is not enough lubrication. This creates small tears in the anus where it is easier for HIV to get in. As with any other type of sex, safer sex is absolutely necessary during anal sex. There are lots of ways to reduce the risk of getting or giving a sexually transmitted disease ( STD ) from anal sex. For example, you can use a condom on the penis or your finger if you're performing anal penetration with your finger. You can also use a female condom on the penis for insertion in the anus. For oral-anal contact, you can use a dental dam over the anal area. People have a lot of different feelings about anal sex. Some people think that only those who identify as gay have anal sex. But that's not true. Anal sex can and is practiced by both gay and heterosexual couples. At the same time, some gay couples and some heterosexual couples don't engage in anal sex. If heterosexual couple are having anal sex, they should never put the penis into the vagina after it has been in the anus without changing the condom or washing the penis first. The bacteria in the anus can cause severe vaginal infections. In addition, regardless of the sex of each partner, after the penis has been in a partner's anus, it should never be inserted into a partner's mouth without changing the condom or washing the penis off first. Just as bacteria in the anus can cause severe vaginal infections, it can also cause oral and intestinal infections. It is also possible to get pregnant through anal sex if semen runs out of the anus into the opening of the vagina, which is not far away\u2014which is another good reason to use a condom. Before engaging in anal intercourse, make sure that you and your partner have discussed and agreed upon it. Never pressure someone or let someone pressure you into having any kind of sex.", "Conception": "The process of an egg and sperm joining in the fallopian tube. Conception is not the same as pregnancy, which is defined by medical experts as the point when the newly fertilized egg implants in the wall of the uterus.", "People talk about good communication in relationships, but what does that mean?": "Communication is an important part of a healthy relationship. It means being able to tell your partner how you feel, what you need, what you believe and what you want. It also means listening to and understanding your partner's feelings, needs, beliefs and desires. It takes time and practice for two people to learn to communicate. It's often the most difficult part of a relationship, but it can be the glue that keeps people together because it allows the relationship to keep growing through mutual respect. If you start to feel uninterested or nervous about speaking honestly and sharing your feelings, needs, beliefs and desires, it may be time to consider if this relationship is still right for you. Communication is about being honest. Just like you can be honest when you begin to really like someone, you can also be honest when you think the relationship is no longer right for you.", "Pelvic Exam": "A medical examination of a girl or woman's internal sexual and reproductive organs (ovaries, uterus and cervix) and external genitals (inner and outer labia and vaginal opening). This exam should be done three years after first vaginal intercourse with a male partner or when a woman turns 21. Girls and women who have sex with other girls and women should have a Pap test when they turn 21.", "Can someone tell if I'm a virgin or not?": "People used to believe you could tell if a girl was a virgin by looking to see if her hymen was torn. Most vaginas have a hymen. The hymen is a thin membrane that stretches partway over the opening to the vagina. In some cultures, bleeding at first intercourse is still considered solid proof that a person is a virgin. But, we know a hymen can be torn as the body grows and develops. Bike riding or playing sports may also cause the hymen to tear. Some females are born without a hymen. Some are elastic and never tear, and some dissolve on their own. And, it's very common for some people not to bleed at all the first time they have sexual intercourse. It's impossible for a doctor to examine someone and tell if they are a virgin. A lot of discussion about virginity is about girls. What about the guys? It is also impossible to tell if a guy is a virgin. Even a doctor can't tell.", "Celibacy": "The decision not to engage in sexual behaviors, whether in the current time or in the future.

All human beings are sexual beings, regardless of ability. Depending on the type of disability, there are lots of things that might need to happen before sex. For example, someone with a spinal cord injury who cannot walk might need help getting into bed with a partner. Other people might need physical help from someone else to get into a position with their partner. Remember that being sexual includes lots of behaviors, not just sex. A physical disability does not make a person any less sexual than anyone else. People with disabilities may have a harder time seeing themselves as attractive and sexual, but only because society sometimes treats people with disabilities as if they are not sexual.

Body image is influenced more by self-esteem than by how physically attractive someone is.", "Does the Pill make you gain weight?": "No. This is a very popular myth that even sexuality educators and doctors repeat. A recent study, \"Combination Contraceptives: Effects on Weight , \" debunked this myth by analyzing data from 44 studies from around the world, dating from 1970 to 2005. This myth probably has stuck because people of all ages tend to gain weight over time, whether they are using birth control or not. So, when women or girls are taking the Pill and they gain weight, guess who gets the blame? The Pill. People tend to blame outside factors for their weight gain, not their own eating or exercise habits. This is especially true for teen girls who are going through puberty at the same time they are taking the Pill. What seems like weight gain from the Pill is actually weight gain from normal development that happens during puberty. Still not convinced? Read a summary of the article for yourself!", "If I carry a condom, do I look like I was expecting sex?": "While some teens think that someone who carries a condom is expecting sex, most think that someone who carries a condom looks prepared and smart. In the end, though, staying safe and protected is more important than someone judging you for carrying a condom. You can also encourage others to carry condoms\u2014you might inspire a condom revolution! Just remember the following: Store condoms in a cool, dry place. Storing them in a wallet, back pocket or in a hot car for long periods of time will make them more likely to break. Avoid throwing them somewhere where they could get punctured by a pin or anything else. What's the bottom line? While letting sex \"just happen\" may feel romantic, it doesn't protect your health. You need to talk about using a condom before you even start engaging in sexual behaviors. When you talk openly about your expectations, both you and your partner understand that if you do have sex, protection is a must. You could ask your partner, \"Hey, what's your favorite condom brand?\" or, \"Is there a drugstore near your place to buy condoms? You know, just in case we decide we want to do that?\" When you talk about using condoms, it doesn't necessarily mean that you are saying you want to have sex at that particular time. It just means that you place a strong value on avoiding pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases (STDs ) or both! Here are a few tips from other teens on talking about condoms and safer sex with a partner: \"I'd simply ask, 'You have protection right?' If they said no then I'd tell them, 'No deal. No condom no sex, but most importantly, no STDs.'\" \u2013Kristen, 17 \"When we're kissing, I ask my boyfriend, 'Hey, you have a condom, right? Just in case?' If he says no, then I let him know I'm going home early, so that we aren't even tempted to go without!\" \u2013Malik, 18 \"My girlfriend buys condoms in bulk from a website, and I pay her back for half. That way we both know we have plenty of condoms. We both know we want to use them, and we both pay for them. It works for us!\" \u2013Drew, 19", "Trichomoniasis": "A sexually transmitted disease that is caused by an organism that lives in the lining of the vaginal walls and causes an odorous, foamy, irritating discharge. Trichomoniasis, or Trich, can be passed between sexual partners (including between male and female partners) and can be cured with antibiotics.", "What is the birth control patch?": "Ortho Evra is the brand name for the birth control patch or \"the Patch.\" The Patch is a thin, beige, smooth patch that looks like an oversized Band-Aid. It releases hormones through the skin to stop a female from releasing eggs (or ovulating). The hormones are similar to those found in birth control pills ( estrogen and progesterone ). A girl places the Patch on her upper shoulder, buttocks, abdomen or upper arm and leaves it in place for one week. After one week, she takes it off and replaces it with a new one. This same cycle happens for three weeks. During the fourth week, she removes the Patch so that bleeding similar to a period can take place. On the following week, she applies a new Patch, and the cycle repeats. When used perfectly, the Patch is more than 99-percent effective at preventing pregnancy. The Patch does not protect against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), so a backup method, such as a male or female condom, should be used. Like the Pill, there can be side effects associated with the Patch. Most girls will have lighter, more regular bleeding and less cramping. Some girls will experience some skin irritation where the Patch is applied. They might also experience nausea, breast tenderness or headaches. And the Patch might not be effective for girls who weigh more than 198 pounds. The Patch is ideal for girls who want regular bleeding each month, have heavy or long periods, bad cramps or for those who will find it easier to remember to change patches every week than take a pill every day. It is not ideal for girls who don't want the patch to be noticed by others. The Patch requires a prescription, just like any other hormonal method of birth control. The cost of the Patch varies, depending on where the prescription is filled. Usually family planning clinics, like Planned Parenthood, are less expensive than a private doctor's office. Insurance may also cover the cost.", "Syphilis": "A sexually transmitted disease that is caused by bacteria and results in chancres or painless sores in the genital area. It can be transmitted when an infected person comes into contact with another uninfected person&#8217;s vagina, penis, anus or mouth. Syphilis can be cured with antibiotics, but if left untreated, can cause brain damage and even death.", "69": "A sexual position for oral sex that involves both partners giving and receiving oral sex simultaneously.

Examples include estrogen and testosterone.", "Fellatio": "The clinical term for oral sex on a male.", "Blow Job": "A slang term for oral sex on a male. Also called \"giving head\" or \"dome\".", "If my partner and I are both virgins, is there any way we could have a sexually transmitted disease (STD)?": "If neither of you has had any kind of sex, then it's unlikely. But the tricky part is defining \" virgin \" and \"sex.\" STDs can spread through oral, vaginal and anal sex and genital skin-to-skin contact. For example, some STDs can be passed through certain types of sexual skin-to-skin touching like when you rub bodies with no clothes on. So, when you and your partner use the word \"virgin,\" make sure you both mean the same thing. There is very little risk for STDs if neither of you has had any sexual experience at all. STDs can spread when people share needles and from mother to child during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding. Even if a person has had no sexual experiences, they could have an STD from using needles or from their mother if she was infected. If you're both virgins, it's still a good idea to get in the habit of using condoms each and every time you have sex. Condoms provide protection from pregnancy and STDs and even though you may not have concerns about STDs now, it's a good habit to get into using condoms. Got a question about STDs? Visit the American Sexual Health Association 's website.", "I told my partner that I have a sexually transmitted disease (STD) and they broke up with me. What can I do to make sure this doesn't happen again?": "Good for you for being honest and telling your partner that you have an STD. It can be a scary thing to do, and even if it did not turn out the way you hoped, you were honest and brave. You should be proud of yourself for that. Unfortunately, no matter how honest you are about telling people about your STD status, you cannot control how they will react. The good thing is that just as there are experiences like the one you just had, there are good ones too. There are people who will be willing to learn about your particular STD, talk to you about it and do what they can to protect themselves. You can also check out the American Sexual Health Association website. They have a lot of resources for people living with STDs, including advice about telling partners, protecting partners from being infected and information about local support groups.", "Antibiotics": "Medications that are prescribed by a health care provider to treat and cure infections caused by bacteria or fungi.", "Train": "When guys get in a line and take turns having intercourse with one or more girls, often against her will. If the person does not consent to this, it is considered rape and it is often referred to as gang rape.", "What is trichomoniasis?": "Trichomoniasis (called trich for short) is a sexually transmitted disease ( STD ) that is caused by a parasitic protozoa organism called trichomonas vaginalis. This organism lives in the lining of the vaginal walls and produces an odorous, foamy, irritating discharge. Symptoms might also include pain during intercourse, pain during urination and itching around the vulva. Trich can be passed between sexual partners. If one partner becomes infected with trich, his or her sexual partners should also be treated so the disease does not continue to pass between them. Trich can be cured with antibiotics.", "When I hear about condoms, I hear people say \"when used correctly.\" What does that really mean? I thought it was pretty obvious how to use one, but now I'm worried that I'm doing something wrong. Do condoms break a lot?": "Condoms have a great track record. When used perfectly, they most likely won't break. Correct use means following these steps every time. When a condom breaks, it's usually because one of these steps wasn't followed. If you buy a package of condoms, first read the directions\u2014usually included inside or printed on the back of the box. The directions should cover the same steps that we have listed in our FAQ on how to use a condom correctly. Numerous studies have been done to test the rate of condom breakage or slippage. Many find that only two percent of condoms break or slip because the material itself is faulty. Usually a condom breaks because a person didn't use it correctly. This explains the difference between \"perfect use\" and \"typical use\" effectiveness rates for condoms. For preventing pregnancy, the perfect-use effectiveness rate for condoms is 98 percent. This means that if 100 couples use a condom perfectly each time they have vaginal sex for an entire year, only two pregnancies would happen. These pregnancies would most likely happen because the condom itself was faulty. The typical-use effectiveness rate for condoms is 85 percent. This means that if 100 couples use condoms and sometimes they use them incorrectly, or they don't use them every time they have sex for an entire year, then 15 pregnancies would happen. Most of these pregnancies that occur would be due to human error, not because the condom itself was faulty.", "Pregnant Minor": "A legal status that is different from being a minor. It is more like having the rights and responsibilities of an adult that allows a teen to make decisions about their prenatal health. The laws vary state to state, but generally a girl is a pregnant minor if she is under 18 and pregnant.

Beneath the shaft of the penis is the scrotum and inside the scrotum, the testicles.", "I feel bad about my body and the way I look. What can I do?": "An unhealthy body image, or feeling really bad about the way you look, can make it harder for you to form friendships and romantic relationships. You might get so focused on your looks that you lose interest in other things, like friends and school. If you have an unhealthy body image, know that you're not alone. Many people feel this way at different times in their lives, but there is no reason to live with these bad feelings. Talk to your parents or another trusted adult \u2014a teacher, relative or clergy person, for example\u2014about your feelings. They can help you locate a counselor or therapist, or maybe help you find a support group of other teens who feel the same way. There are resources available to help you. The key is learning how to change your attitude about your body, not changing your body or looks. You may change one part of your body you are unhappy with, but it won't help to solve the deeper issue. It is rewarding to instead accept your body and learn to love the way you look. Body acceptance means being OK with who you are on the outside and inside. It means having a good life\u2014feeling good, taking care of yourself\u2014no matter what size, shape or color you are, instead of just focusing on changing your body. Body acceptance is about saying no to warped and unrealistic images of beauty and celebrating the beauty of diverse body shapes, sizes and colors. It's about loving your body and accepting yourself for who you are.", "The girl I had sex with is pregnant. Do I have a say in the decision about what to do? What if we disagree?": "In many relationships, especially when they're healthy and communication is open, the partner is the first to find out after a girl or woman learns of her pregnancy. In a situation like that, they can discuss options and he may have some influence on what happens. However, legally, when it comes down to the final decision, you do not have a say. Under the law, the pregnant girl or woman gets to decide what to do about the pregnancy, whether it's abortion, adoption or raising the child. That's her legal right. Some girls and women want the father of their baby involved in the decision; others do not. There are a variety of relationship and personal reasons why either of these might be the case. Some Things to Consider: Think about how you feel about the pregnancy and the idea of becoming a dad. Do some soul-searching. Guys have different reactions when hearing the news initially. Some are shocked. Others are happy. Others are confused. Others are stressed and wonder how they could manage being a father right now. It's important to work through whatever feelings you have, perhaps with someone close to you, before you talk to her. When you talk to her, listen to how she feels and what she wants. Ask questions. Calmly tell her how you feel. Answer her questions. If the two of you disagree about what to do, don't try to pressure her to accept your point of view. Once you know that she understands your side, even if she disagrees, take some alone time for both of you to think. Agree on a time to come back together and discuss it again. It's also important for you to spend some time figuring out how you feel about the child's mother. How would you define your relationship with her? Are you together as a couple? Are you just friends? Are you barely speaking? What kind of relationship would you like with her in the future? After you've had some time to yourself, it can be helpful to talk things through with a trusted adult in your life. Ultimately, the decision about what to do about a pregnancy is the girl's decision. When she makes a final decision it's best to start thinking about the next steps, not only for you personally, but also for your relationship. Once you work out the type of relationship the two of you want, you can focus on figuring out ways to handle the situation together. That includes dividing up responsibilities. Who will do what for the baby? How will you pay for the expenses of raising a child, or how will you pay for the abortion? Will you stay in school or get a job? Or who will research adoption agencies? Here are some links to more information on being a father. If your partner chooses to have an abortion and you need or want to talk with someone about your feelings after the abortion, contact the Exhale hotline.", "I'm a guy, but I have what looks like a girl's breasts. Why is this happening?": "During puberty, some guys may develop swollen breasts or a growth of tissue under the nipples. While this might seem weird, it's nothing to be concerned about. If it happens to you, don't worry\u2014it's just a part of growing for some guys. It happens because some hormones cause the tissue at the breast to swell. It does go away for most guys, usually within two years. For other guys, it usually goes away by age 18. If it is stressing you out, ask your doctor about it.", "Is it normal to have hair \"down there\"? Should I shave my pubic hair?": "It's completely normal to have hair in the genital region; it's called pubic hair. The hair usually grows on the \" mons pubis \" for a female and just above and around the penis for a male. Pubic hair provides warmth and padding for the genital area. It also traps dirt and germs that can get inside genital openings ( vagina or urethra for females and urethra for males). Shaving your pubic hair is really a personal choice. There are plenty of girls and guys who don't shave their pubic hair and plenty who do. Something to be aware of is that when people shave their pubic hair, they usually itch while the hair grows back. Also, after shaving, this sensitive skin area can also become irritated and sore without hair covering it. If you do decide to shave, take a warm bath first, and use a new, clean razor. Most people find it helpful to use shaving cream or gel. Shave in the direction of the hair growth. When you shave against the direction of the hair growth, you are more likely to see irritated bumps or ingrown hairs afterwards. After shaving, you may want to put on some powder on the area you shaved. This will help avoid itching and irritation.", "Abstinence": "This word means not doing something. It is most commonly used to describe not engaging in sexual behaviors. Each person decides which sexual behaviors they include in their definition of abstinence. A person who practices sexual abstinence may say that they are \"abstinent,\" and what qualifies as being abstinent from sexual behaviors can vary from person to person.", "Androgynous": "This term describes someone or something that is gender neutral or non-gendered. It can refer to things like clothing or social status.", "Group Sex": "When more than two people are having sex with each other at the same time.", "Intimacy": "Feelings of closeness and trust with another person.", "I'm trans. I've been hanging out with someone I like, but this person doesn't know that I'm trans. What should I do?": "Communication is a key element in any relationship. Talking with someone you're interested in isn't easy. For people who are trans, this can seem like an even bigger challenge. Start by thinking about what's behind your question. Are you hoping to become good friends? Or more? Do you feel that not telling this person about your gender identity is unfair or dishonest? Do you want this person to know more about you so you feel closer and more understood? Are things becoming more serious and you want to talk to your friend now to avoid embarrassment or a surprise later on? Or maybe you think this person may already sense there's something more you want to tell them and you want to set the record straight. Before you take action, you might want to consider the following: Do you expect that the conversation will be kept private? How will you feel if it isn't? Consider the best possible outcome as well as the worst. How will you feel, realistically, if each one happens? Are you willing to accept those outcomes, and others that you might not have anticipated? What are you hoping will happen if you tell this person? What if that doesn't happen? Here are some suggestions if you decide you want to tell this person you're trans: Find the right time and place. Because many people assume there are only two genders, someone may be surprised to have their understanding challenged. Pick a place and a time that is private, but not isolated, where you won't be interrupted, but where there are other people in case the situation becomes unsafe. Be prepared to give your friend some information. He or she might be surprised or curious and could benefit from some additional information about trans issues and time to absorb what you have to say. On the other hand, there are also people who know a lot about transgender people, so be prepared for someone who might react with confusion or hurt by saying, \"Why did you take so long to tell me? Didn't you trust me?\" Have some patience. People's reactions can be very mixed\u2014surprise, fear, delight, disbelief, joy. Some people may also have a lot of questions like, \"Are you sure?\" or, \"How did you know?\" Remember that just as some trans people may take time to fully understand themselves, people who aren't trans may need time to understand their friends who are trans. Try to be patient and maintain open communication and remind the person of how important it is that you are sharing this part of yourself with them. Be ready to answer questions. If society builds an awareness and acceptance of the diversity of gender identities, trans people who are \"out\" will become more common and understanding will increase. Many societies throughout history have recognized and celebrated gender diversity. With increased understanding and education, our society can become a more inviting and comfortable place to express all the parts of an individual's sense of self.", "Tubal Ligation": "A surgical procedure to prevent pregnancy in which the fallopian tubes are tied or cut and burned to prevent ova (eggs) from entering the uterus. It is designed to be a permanent procedure, although with additional surgery it can sometimes be successfully reversed. This is sometimes called \"getting your tubes tied.\"", "Fear-Based Sexuality Programs": "These are educational programs that are usually part of abstinence-only-until-marriage efforts that use scare tactics to try to keep teens from having sex.

Some women can also ejaculate during orgasm when fluid is released from the urethra. (This fluid is not urine.)", "When I have sex, I pull out before I ejaculate and nothing bad has ever happened. So, why do people always say pulling out is risky?": "Withdrawal, or pulling out, is when a guy pulls his penis out of his partner before he ejaculates, so that no semen enters his partner's body. If his partner is female and we're talking about vaginal intercourse, if he is able to pull out without releasing any semen on or near the opening of the vagina, then withdrawal is pretty effective as a method of birth control. But, a girl can get pregnant even if a guy ejaculates just a little bit of semen near the vaginal opening or just inside of her vagina. When used perfectly, withdrawal prevents pregnancy about 96 percent of the time. But that drops to a risky 73 percent with typical or \"real world\" use, because many guys don't have enough control to pull out in time, especially when they're so close to the pleasure of orgasm and ejaculation. Also, a recent study showed that some guys' pre-cum contains sperm. Withdrawal is better than doing nothing, but there are many methods of birth control that are more effective. Keep in mind that pregnancy isn't the only concern here. Safer sex is not just about preventing unplanned pregnancy. It's also about preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Even if a guy doesn't ejaculate in his partner, STDs can be spread through pre- cum and vaginal and anal fluids, and in some cases (like herpes and HPV ), through skin-to-skin contact. Some people also practice withdrawal during anal sex, but the risk of spreading STDs is still very high for the reasons listed above. Condoms are a much safer choice to avoid STDs and pregnancy. Find a clinic near you to get tested for pregnancy and/or STDs or call 1-800-230-PLAN (7526) to be connected to the Planned Parenthood health center nearest you.", "Twat": "A slang term for the vulva or vagina.", "Cooch": "A slang term for vagina.", "Incest": "Sexual intercourse or other sexual behaviors between people who are closely related. How this relationship is defined can vary from country to country, and include being related by blood (like a biological parent and a child), or living in the same household (like a stepparent and child or step-siblings). Incest is illegal in the United States and in some, but not all, countries around the world.", "I'm gay, lesbian or bisexual and don't want to be. Can I change my sexual orientation?": "Your sexual orientation is something that is part of you\u2014just like the color of your eyes and the shape of your nose. You can't change your sexual orientation. In a society where lesbian, gay and bisexual people still do not feel accepted, this can be difficult to hear. That's why it's important to find a trusted adult to talk through what you're feeling. If you can't or don't accept a piece of yourself, it can affect all areas of your life. Coming to terms with how you feel and integrating it into who you are is a difficult process, and regardless of orientation, it's usually a process that requires support along the way. You might also be in a situation where you're pretty sure of your orientation but still have some doubts. That's OK. It's normal not to have all the answers! For most people, understandings about sexual orientation change throughout life. Our society generally accepts being heterosexual as \"normal.\" That puts a lot of pressure on lesbian, gay and bisexual people to suppress their true feelings and try to fit in. Trying to fit in can seem easier, even if it means being someone you're not. A lot of times, though, people realize they can't pretend for their whole life. So they come out. They haven't \"become\" lesbian, gay or bisexual. They've just accepted who they are. Some groups claim people can change their sexual orientation through prayer or therapy. Through research, the American Psychological Association has found that these approaches are unlikely to be successful and involve some risk of harm. People might change their sexual behavior, but behavior is different than orientation. Maybe they start having sex with a member of a different gender. Or they might stop having sex altogether. But that doesn't change their inner feelings of who they find attractive.", "Arousal": "The physiological changes that occur as a result of sexual excitement. These include an erection, vaginal lubrication and an increased sense of sexual arousal.", "What does it mean to be a \"player?\"": "The term \" player \" is usually used to describe someone who is interested in the sexual side of a relationship but not the other parts of a relationship. It's OK to want to get to know lots of people and stay away from a committed relationship. But it's important to be honest with the people you're seeing or talking to. Otherwise, you might mislead or hurt people, especially if the \"playing\" includes sex. You also have to think about your sexual health and that of other people.", "What is \"gay pride?\"": "When you understand your sexual orientation and gender identity at a young age, feel safe in telling friends and family members\u2014and feel proud of who you are\u2014there can be a huge sense of empowerment. Because of shared experiences, groups sometimes develop their own community and culture around their similarities. For many LGBTQ people of all ages, being a member of any of these communities can make them feel like they belong and have support for being themselves. This sense of community is often called \" gay pride.\" It applies to lesbian, gay and bisexual people. When it refers to transgender people, it may be referred to as \"trans pride.\" As more and more transgender people are finding each other, they are building their own community, and with it, their own sense of pride in being who they are. So while there are many challenges for LGBTQ people, there are also many wonderful things. Everyone should be able to express and celebrate who they are!", "Splooge": "A slang term for to ejaculate.", "What's a penis and what does it do?": "The penis is a male sexual and reproductive organ located on the outside of the body. It has two main parts: the shaft and the glans (or the head ). The inside of the shaft of the penis is made up of spongy tissue. When that tissue fills with blood, the penis becomes hard. This is called an erection. The head has a lot of nerve endings, which is why touching the penis can feel good. Inside the penis is a tube called the urethra. Urine (or pee) passes through this as well as semen. Semen comes out of the urethra when a guy ejaculates. Semen contains sperm, or reproductive cells, that can make a girl pregnant. Luckily, when a guy has an erection, there is a ring of muscle inside the body that closes off the bladder and makes it impossible for urine to come out. Penises come in all shapes and sizes. But the average length of an erect, adult penis is between five and seven inches. Because teen boys' bodies are growing through puberty, there is no accurate average size for younger guys. Most guys reach their full adult penis size by the time they get into their early 20s. A lot of guys get hung up on the size of their penis. But the truth is that size doesn't matter that much when it comes to being able to give or receive sexual pleasure. Pleasing a partner is not about the size and shape of body parts, but being with the right person for you. Some penises curve and some are straight. A curved penis may just mean that there's more spongy tissue on one side of the shaft than the other. That causes the penis to bend when it fills with blood and becomes erect. Only if the penis is bent in the shape of an L should it cause any pain or problem with sexual functioning. If you have pain when you have an erection or the curve gets worse, have a doctor check it out.", "Statutory Rape": "Sexual intercourse with a person who is under a certain age. This age varies from state to state, but it is usually between 12 and 18 years old.", "Dick": "A slang term for penis.", "Health Care provider": "A licensed doctor, nurse, nurse practitioner or midwife who provides information, testing, services and resources relating to one's health.", "Why do I have breasts?": "Breasts perform different functions. Breasts are part of someone's sexuality ; they can be sensitive and can provide pleasure during sexual activity. Glands inside the breasts produce milk for breastfeeding a baby. This can provide the baby's first source of nutrition if a mother chooses to breastfeed. Breasts come in all different shapes, sizes and colors\u2014all unique in their own way. It's also common for girls to have one breast that's bigger than the other. Lots of girls worry that their breasts are too big or small or not shaped perfectly, but each girl's differences are what make her unique and special. The light pink to dark brown circle in the center of each breast is called the areola. Some girls also have smaller bumps in the areola, like goose bumps, and some have hair growing out of the areola\u2014all of this is normal. Some girls have very large areolas while some are very small. Areolas can be different sizes. The raised up area at the center of the areola is the nipple. Some girls have nipples that stick out, and others have ones that are inverted (stick in). Nipples can get erect (hard) if a girl is cold, excited or sexually aroused. Girls don't have control over when their nipples become erect.", "Epididymis": "A coiled tube that stores sperm before it leaves the testes.", "Vaginal Contraceptive Film (VCF)": "A spermicide that is a paper-thin sheet of polyurethane that is placed inside the vagina close to the cervix and that dissolves with body heat and releases spermicide. This is a method of birth control that is meant to be used as a back-up to another method, such as a condom. On its own, VCF has a very low effectiveness rate for preventing pregnancy and provides no protection against STDs.", "What is gender identity?": "Gender identity means our internal sense of being feminine, masculine or something else entirely. It's different from sexual orientation, which is about who we're attracted to sexually and romantically. Gender identity, just like sexual orientation, is based in the brain. This means that even though a person might have female body parts\u2014a vulva, vagina and ovaries\u2014she might not feel like a girl. The same goes for a person who has a penis and testicles, but doesn't feel like his male body parts match the feelings he has inside. People who believe their gender identity\u2014the feelings they have inside\u2014are different from their body parts may identify themselves as transgender or genderqueer. &nbsp;", "My partner and I just broke up, and I'm just really sad. What can I do?": "It's tough when relationships end, whether or not you are the person who ended it. And it's even harder when you didn't want it to end or it was unexpected. Sometimes relationships end, even if strong feelings exist between two people. A couple might discover they have different values or needs in their lives that just don't fit with the relationship anymore. Sometimes, like when one partner goes to college, couples have to live far apart, and the relationship can't survive the distance or the differences between high school and college. Other times, two people have differences that make the relationship unhealthy for one or both. And sometimes, the connection and feelings fade. Give yourself time to grieve and feel whatever emotions come with the change in your life. It's hard to say how much time you'll need before you feel better. Some people need a long time, while others bounce back pretty quickly. While it may not seem like it now, the feelings will become less intense with time. For now, take care of yourself. Spend time with family and friends; talk to people who you know care about you. It can be helpful to find new things to do, like clubs, sports or other activities where you can meet new people and take your mind off of the change in your life. Being with friends and exploring new interests can help you focus on you and what's important to you. You can use this experience to make choices about who you want to get into a relationship with in the future.

HPV has also been linked to penile and anal cancer in men in some rare cases.", "I'm about to have sex for the first time. Will it hurt? Will there be blood?": "Some don't experience pain or bleeding the first time they have sexual intercourse. Some do. Most vaginas have a hymen, which is a thin elastic (stretchy) piece of skin that partially covers the entrance to the vagina. When there is pain or bleeding during first-time vaginal intercourse, it may be due to the hymen getting stretched or torn. Some hymens are very thin, and others are thick. Check out these illustrations to see for yourself! Many hymens tear or stretch before vaginal intercourse for the first time, and the person may not know this has happened. Hymens can be stretched or torn by things like riding a bike or doing gymnastics. For those who have very thick hymens, first-time vaginal intercourse (or trying to use a tampon ) may hurt or seem impossible. If someone experiences intense pain during vaginal intercourse or while attempting vaginal intercourse, they should stop trying and talk to their doctor to make sure everything is OK. The most common reason that sex can be painful is because of too little vaginal lubrication because the person hasn't been sexually aroused enough during foreplay. During sexual arousal, the walls of the vagina respond by releasing a liquid that wets or \"lubricates\" the vagina. This makes it easier for something to enter the vagina and feel good. If the person hasn't been sexually aroused, their vagina can be dry, making it uncomfortable to have anything inserted. Some couples like to buy water-based lubricants from the store to make sex feel better. Sex can also hurt if you're scared or not ready for it. People who are having sex for the first time tend to be nervous. This can make sex painful, so it's important to relax and be sure you're ready to have sex. You're more likely to relax if you're with a partner you know and trust. The right partner is someone you can talk to before, during and after sex, and who's willing to make the first time more pleasurable and comfortable for you both. Remember, a health care provider can also talk with you about your concerns about painful sex, as well as birth control and preventing STDs.

Is it normal that a 13-year-old wants to have sex already?": "It's normal for people to start thinking about having sex when they reach their teen years. Puberty makes people curious and more aware of their sexual feelings and other people's sexuality. Sometimes these feelings can be overwhelming, and people think they have to act on them to get them to go away. This isn't true. Even though you may feel turned on or like you want to have sex, it doesn't mean you are ready to have sex. There is a lot more to having a good sexual experience than just feeling desire or being curious about what sex might feel like. It is important to also have a healthy and trusting relationship with a partner before you have any kind of sexual experience. There are a lot of good things and bad things that can result from having sex. Sex is just one of many ways to share intimacy with a partner, but it also has serious consequences, like getting pregnant or getting a sexually transmitted disease ( STD ). If someone isn't ready for sex, they might feel regret later or realize that they didn't make a good decision and wish they could change it. Some teens find that masturbation can help release their sexual feelings if they become a distraction. Masturbation is when someone touches their own body for sexual pleasure. It can sometimes result in orgasm, but doesn't have to. Eventually, you will decide when you are ready to be sexual with a partner. At that point, be sure you can talk openly with your partner so that you can explain what you do or don't want to do. For example, maybe you feel comfortable kissing and rubbing with clothes on, but don't want to do anything else. Both partners need to know each other's limits so that no one feels forced, uncomfortable or regrets something the next day. Someday you will feel ready for sex. Many teens wait until they've graduated from high school or are in a certain kind of committed relationship, like being in love, being with a person for a certain amount of time or being married. When you think you're ready, talk to friends, parents or someone you trust to talk about the decision. Take time to talk to your partner about it, too, and make sure it is what they also want. Most likely, if you take time to make sure you are ready for sex, then it will feel good and you won't regret it later.

That's her legal right. While you have no legal say in her decision, you can certainly discuss the options with her and let her know your opinion. Sometimes guys leave the protection and birth control concerns up to girls, and that's not necessary. Birth control and safer sex are the responsibility of both partners. Of course, you can always choose not to have sex, which is the only way to be sure to prevent pregnancy. If you decide to have sex, you and your partner should visit a local clinic, like Planned Parenthood, to learn about all of your contraceptive options. You should also wear a condom, even if your sexual partner is on birth control, to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).", "HIV/AIDS Education": "Education that discusses how HIV is transmitted and how to protect yourself from becoming infected with HIV.

Many do tell their partners, who might then go with them to offer support during the abortion procedure, but this is not something you have to do.

For partners who choose to have vaginal sex, the most effective way to avoid a pregnancy and/or STDs is by using hormonal birth control, like the pill, and/or a condom. Typically, vaginal sex is done between a male and female partner, but two girls or women can also use toys to have vaginal sex.", "I just had unprotected sex. What is emergency contraception? Is it the same as the \"morning-after pill\"?": "It depends on what you mean by \"just,\" and it depends on what you mean by \" sex.\" If a girl had unprotected vaginal sex with a guy in the last five days, she can take emergency contraception (EC). EC can be taken up to 120 hours (five days) after having unprotected vaginal-penile sex. EC should be taken as soon as possible though, as this may increase the chance that it will prevent pregnancy. The sooner a girl takes EC, the better. It can reduce the chance of a pregnancy by up to 89 percent. Emergency contraception (EC) is basically a high dose of certain types of birth control pills. The current brand names for EC in the U.S. are Plan B One-Step, ella and Next Choice. Plan B One Step and ella require that you take one pill. Next Choice requires you to take two pills, 12 hours apart. Read the instructions on the package to be sure you are taking the medication properly. Plan B One-Step emergency contraception is not effective at preventing pregnancy in people over 176 pounds. If you weigh over 176 pounds and need emergency contraception, you should speak to a health care provider about possibly using another emergency contraceptive pill or a copper IUD. EC is not an abortion ; it works by preventing pregnancy before it happens. EC will not end a pregnancy that has already started. This is why it's so important to take it as soon as possible after unprotected sex. Unprotected sex includes not using any method of birth control or condoms, being a survivor of rape or sexual assault or having a method fail (like a condom breaking). You can get Plan B One Step without a prescription over-the-counter at a local pharmacy. Next Choice, Next Choice One Dose and Levonorgestrel are other kinds of EC that are approved for sale without a prescription to men and women 17 and older directly from a pharmacist. If you are 16 or younger, you will need a prescription for these. ella is only available with a prescription regardless of age. If you need a prescription for EC, you can find a health care provider near you, as well as answers to your questions about EC, at NOT-2-LATE.com, the Emergency Contraception website. As with any birth control pills, there are some possible side effects to taking EC. Some girls may experience side effects, but many don't experience any at all. The most common side effects are nausea, pain in the lower abdomen, changes in the menstrual cycle, headache, fatigue and dizziness. EC provides no protection against HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). And if a couple had unprotected sex, either or both partners could be at risk for an STD. Anyone who has unprotected sex should get tested for STDs. Find a clinic that provides EC, STD testing and other sexual health services.", "I'm pregnant and not sure what I want to do yet. What should I consider about teen parenting before I make a decision?": "There are many, many pros and cons to think about. Here's our list of things to take into consideration. Possible Pros Parenting\u2014including loving a child and being loved in return, watching that child grow and develop\u2014can be one of the most joyful experiences in life. Most people, both teens and adults, find that becoming a parent pushes them to a new level of responsibility. A parent realizes that a child is completely dependent, so that parent may get and keep a job to support the child. Some teens or adults may really enjoy this responsibility. It can be rewarding, though difficult, work. Possible Cons Teen parents cannot live the life of a typical teenager. You will not be able to go out with friends as often. You will have to figure out how to finish school while caring for a baby who needs care 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Your life will revolve around another person who depends on you. Teen parents need money because raising a child is expensive. Many teen parents are still in high school, so they don't necessarily have the skills or experience to get a job that supports them as well as a baby. If they drop out of high school to work and therefore don't have a high school diploma, teen parents may only qualify for lower-paying jobs. Those teen parents who go on to higher-paying careers may have to depend on the support of parents or others in their lives while they continue with high school, skill training or college. Babies also change relationships between couples. Parenting can put a lot of stress\u2014financial and other day-to-day stress\u2014on even the most solid relationships. If the couple splits up, there can be bad feelings and conflict that may interfere with the support needed to raise a child. Despite this, children can benefit from the positive involvement of both parents. Being a parent may mean working hard to maintain good communication with someone you are no longer involved with. Financial Costs The average yearly cost of having a child under the age of two is between $9,500 (for a child raised in a single parent household) and $14,500 (for a child raised in a two-parent household), according to the Expenditures on Children by Families 2008 report. Annual costs for raising a child increase each year of the child's life. This cost depends on a lot of factors. Rent is typically the most expensive part of a household budget. So, you need to figure out where you'll live and how much that will cost. Staying with your parent(s) or other relatives, either rent-free or with a low rent, may be an option you can consider. Other major expenses are food, clothes, health care, day care, transportation and any future training you might need for a job (technical school, GED classes, college, etc.). Check out websites that offer \"baby calculators\" to get a personalized look at how much you would probably spend. Another way to understand these costs is to do some basic research in your area. When you have collected the prices below, use them to create a realistic budget. Spend some time in the grocery store checking out prices, including baby food. How much would three meals a day cost? For a month? Look in the newspaper at the cost of one- or two-bedroom apartments and utilities. Price at least one full outfit for a child. Try to estimate childcare costs. Who will watch your child while you're in school or working? Do you have a relative who can help for free or at a low cost? Or call a local day care facility and ask for yearly or monthly prices. Try to estimate the cost of transportation. If you have a car, how much are your payments, insurance, gas, maintenance and repairs? If you use public transportation, what impact will having a baby have on the number of times you travel? How much will this cost each month? Get a sense of how much health care will cost for you. Do you have health insurance? How much is a visit to the doctor or clinic? Try to estimate costs for health care for a child. How much is it to add a child to your insurance policy? If you don't have insurance, look into getting a policy just for your child. How much is one visit to the doctor or clinic? What about a trip to the emergency room? If you can't earn enough money to pay the bills, there are programs that can help, at least a little. You may be eligible for public assistance, which could potentially help with income, health insurance or food. You can also get help with food through the government WIC program. Most states now help single mothers pay for childcare while they attend school or work. If you need to, you should look at using these programs while you establish yourself. The long-term goal is to take care of yourself and your child. These programs can help get you there. Under the law, all legal fathers must pay child support. However, if you are not married to your baby's father, he may not be considered the legal father; the process for establishing paternity\u2014proving that he is the legal father\u2014varies from state to state.", "How can you tell if someone might become abusive in a relationship? What are some of the effects of abuse?": "The answer to this question isn't clear-cut. It's really hard to tell up front whether someone might become abusive. Abusers can often be very charming in the beginning. That's why many people get trapped in abusive relationships. They don't see it coming, and by the time they recognize the abuse, they feel like they've caused it or can't get out of it. Abusers usually blame their partners for the abuse. They might say things like, \"I can't believe you made me hit you.\" That's how abusers keep their partners afraid and dependent. Here are some questions to ask yourself if you think you might be in an abusive relationship: Does your partner\u2026 Constantly criticize you, your intelligence and/or your self-worth? Act jealous, especially when other people try to talk to you or spend time with you? Make threats against you or someone you care about? Try to keep you from having any friends, especially friends they might see as potential romantic competition? Have problems controlling their temper\u2014even if it's not directed at you? Insist that you do something sexual that you don't want to do, even when you have told them you don't want to? Often, abusive people justify their behavior as love or flattery, at least in the beginning. Think about it. Your partner gets a little jealous when someone else flirts with you. That can feel flattering for some people. Abusive people can also be very subtle when they isolate their partner from friends and family. You might not even notice it's happening. They just say things like, \"Let's go do something, just the two of us,\" or, \"I just want to spend time with you.\" Again, some of this can be normal, but it can also be a sign of abuse when it happens a lot. You may start to notice that your friends have slipped out of the picture. And then when the trouble begins or gets worse, there's no one there to turn to for help or support. The abusive person has isolated you and made you more dependent. That's the whole idea behind an abusive relationship. It might start out feeling harmless, but then it can escalate to the point where it's unhealthy because it's used as a form of control. Abuse Can Leave Many Types of Wounds According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some of the possible effects of teen dating abuse include the following: Increased difficulty in school Higher risk of developing an eating disorder or depression Increased use of alcohol and other drugs Higher likelihood of having an abusive partner in the future Those can sound like pretty big, scary things, but it doesn't mean that if you've experienced abuse that you're doomed. Not everyone experiences those effects and a lot can depend on what kind of support you have in your life and whether you're able to seek out help. If you are experiencing abuse in your relationship or you're worried that it's just not healthy, there's help available. There's lot of good info out there on the Web about abusive relationships.

Bacterial infections are caused by bacteria. They include chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis. These can be cured by taking antibiotics. Viral infections are caused by a virus. They include herpes (HSV-1 or HSV-2), human papillomavirus ( HPV ), hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ), the virus that causes AIDS. HSV-1, HSV-2 and HIV stay with a person for life and can be passed to partners even if there are no symptoms. In some cases, HPV and hepatitis B can be cleared from the body, but there are also times when they stay with a person for life. There is no cure for HIV. Parasitic infections are caused by parasites (tiny bugs) that live in the pubic hair. They include scabies and pubic lice (\" crabs \"). They can be spread during skin-to-skin sexual contact and from sharing bath towels, bedding and clothing. Scabies and lice can be cured with prescription soap. &nbsp;", "Ectopic Pregnancy": "When a fertilized egg implants itself outside of the uterus, usually in the fallopian tubes. Since most ectopic pregnancies implant in the fallopian tube, they are also sometimes called tubal pregnancies. In this situation the fetus is not viable, which means it cannot survive. All ectopic pregnancies need to be terminated; if left untreated, they can be dangerous to the woman's health.", "What do I do if a condom breaks?": "If partners are having vaginal or anal sex and the condom breaks or slips off inside the vagina or anus before the guy ejaculates, they should stop having sex immediately. If they want to start having sex again right after this happens, they should put on a new condom before they continue. If a condom breaks or slips off, the female partner can still use emergency contraception within five days to avoid a pregnancy. If the condom slips off inside of someone and she or he can't get it out, she or he can go to a health care provider and have it removed. Don't worry, they're used to this and know how to get it out easily. If any couple is having anal sex and the condom slips off or breaks, there's no risk of pregnancy\u2014unless the couple is a guy and a girl and semen spills from the anus to the vagina\u2014but there is risk of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs ), including HIV. It'd be a really good idea for both partners to get tested. These are the most common reasons a condom slips off or breaks: It was put on incorrectly (the tip wasn't pinched or it was rolled on the wrong way). It was old (the expiration date passed). It was ripped or exposed to high temperatures wherever it was stored. If your condom breaks, review the steps for how to use a condom to make sure it doesn't happen again.

It can refer to men or women, although many gay women will use the term \"lesbian.\" Also known as homosexual, which some gay people feel is a derogatory word because homosexuality used to be a diagnosable mental illness.", "Sterilization": "A permanent form of birth control. It is a minor operation that stops the ovum (egg) and sperm from joining. Typically, this method is used by older men and women who have decided they do not want any more children.

Intersex people may have XO, XXY, XYY or any other combination of chromosomes and anatomy. The outdated word for intersex people is \"hermaphrodite;\" today that term is considered demeaning.", "PID": "Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) is an infection of the internal reproductive organs in a girl or woman, typically the result of untreated gonorrhea or chlamydia.

Some girls may have light or irregular bleeding, called \"spotting,\" when they're pregnant. This can be similar to a period for some girls, but a girl cannot be pregnant and still get her period. If a girl or woman knows she's pregnant and experiences this bleeding, she should see her doctor or clinician right away.", "I just found out that I'm pregnant (or that a girl I know is pregnant). What should I do? How do I tell my parent(s)?": "If a girl took a pregnancy test, either at home or in a clinic, and it came back positive, she has a decision to make. A girl who is faced with an unplanned pregnancy has three choices: Abortion. Adoption. Parent. The decision of what to do when faced with an unplanned pregnancy is often really hard to make, especially for a teenager. It can be helpful to talk with the person with whom you had sex, to see how they feel about the situation. It can also be helpful to talk with an adult in your life\u2014whom you know well and trust\u2014to help you sort through the three choices. But in the end, the pregnant girl is the one who needs to make this decision for herself. No girl should keep or terminate a pregnancy based solely on what her parents or partner wants. How does someone decide? Every girl is different. Therefore, she needs to look at her own life circumstances to make the decision that is best for her. Here are some questions a girl who is faced with an unplanned pregnancy can ask herself. The answers can help her determine which decision is best for her. How do I feel about abortion? How do I feel about adoption? How do I feel about having a baby now? What are my goals for the next year? Five years? Ten years? How would having a baby now affect these goals? Where am I in school? Do I plan to finish high school and go to college? How would having a baby affect this? What is my financial situation? How would my choice affect me financially? What kind of social support do I have in my life? Regardless of what a girl chooses to do, it's best to make a decision as soon as possible. If she chooses to place her baby with an adoption agency or to become a parent, she needs to see a health care professional for prenatal visits. If she chooses adoption, she should begin the process of selecting an adoption agency. If she chooses to terminate the pregnancy by having an abortion, it should be done as early in the pregnancy as possible. How do I tell my parents? Find a time and place where you can talk privately with your parent(s) or guardians. You can bring a friend or other adult along to support you if you think that might make it easier for you. Start by saying you have something really important to tell them. You can also say that it's taken a lot of courage for you to be honest with them. Then, just tell them. Parents or guardians of teenagers have a variety of reactions to news of a pregnancy. By the time you tell them, you've probably had some time to adjust to the idea of pregnancy yourself. Your parent(s) or guardian(s) may need a similar adjustment period. In the end, the majority of parents or guardians want what is best for their child, and when it comes to a pregnancy, it's no different. You know your parent(s) or guardian(s) and your situation the best, and while many girls will feel nervous or scared about having this conversation with their parent(s) or guardian(s), some may just have a sense that it's not safe for them to talk to their immediate family. If you feel like it would be unsafe to share about your pregnancy with your immediate family, it might help to talk with another trusted adult\u2014like a teacher, counselor, health care professional, community leader or relative\u2014about your situation beforehand. Sometimes having the support of another adult, either in person or just emotionally, can help assure that you feel comforted. You can also check out Mom, Dad, I'm Pregnant to get some more ideas about how to approach this conversation with your family. A great hotline for teens is called Backline at 1-888-493-0092.

There are two types of breast exams: one is done by a health care provider and the other is a breast self-exam. The purpose of a breast self-exam is to have a girl familiarize herself with her own body, so if she does feel anything unusual, she can have it checked out by a health care provider. Breast exams help health care providers, women and girls identify noncancerous growths, like cysts, as well as breast cancer, which is extremely rare in teen girls. While breast cancer is more common in women over 40, it does occur in men as well. Women and girls should perform breast self-exams once a month. A good rule for a girl to follow is to do the exam a week after her period. Learn how to perform a breast self-exam.", "My best friend went to a party and someone brought my friend a drink. Before my friend knew it, s/he was in another room, unable to move. My friend was raped. What happened?": "Rohypnol or \"roofies\" is a powerful sedative that can make someone unable to move or talk. It's often referred to as the \" date- rape drug\" because it can knock someone out or make it so they can't move or speak. \"Roofies\" can also cause someone to forget exactly what happened to them while they were under the influence of the drug. Someone may slip \"roofies\" into a drink in order to have control over the person they wish to rape and increase the chances they won't remember anything. Another drug commonly used in these situations is called GHB. GHB, which is colorless and odorless in its liquid form, can be added to a drink without anyone noticing. GHB, much like Rohypnol, can make it so that someone is not able to resist or say no. GHB can also cause memory problems. Having sex with people when they didn't want to\u2014or when they weren't able to say whether they wanted to\u2014is considered rape.

Know that it is OK to have good and bad body image days. Someone can have a day when they feel bad about their body and not have an unhealthy body image. There is also a difference between an unhealthy body image and eating disorders. They are different problems with very different treatments; one doesn't necessarily come with the other. Listen to your friend with understanding, respect and sensitivity. Tell your friend you are concerned, that you care and would like to help. Ask your friend if he or she would like to talk to a counselor about his or her body image. Talk about things other than food, weight and body image. Focus on other aspects of your friend's personality, complimenting him or her on a good test grade or a smart response in class or what a great friend they are to you. Chances are there is a lot more to your friend than their appearance, and that's why you like them! Confront bad body talk in a sensitive yet direct way. If your friend says mean things about his or her body, let your friend know that you don't like when he or she says hateful things about his or her body. And it's important to know the things that don't really help when you have a friend with an unhealthy body image: Don't try to solve your friend's problems for him or her. Don't blame your friend or say he or she is acting silly. Don't say things like, \"Shut up, I would love to have your body!\" This can make your friend feel like his or her feelings aren't valid. Don't gossip about your friend. Don't focus all your attention on looks or weight. Don't make comments about people's appearance. Be open. Talk with your friend about what you think and feel. Don't reject or ignore your friend or the issues. Don't ignore your friend's body preoccupation.

You need to do what is right for you, no matter what you've done in the past. When it comes to sex, part of the decision-making process is evaluating the decision after it happens. Some people realize that, for whatever reason, they weren't ready for a sexual relationship. You are entitled to decide whether you want to have sex, even if you've had sex with your partner, or another one, before. You can change your mind, and your partner must respect your choice. The bottom line is it doesn't matter if you've never had sex, done it 10 times or 100 times; you still get to decide each and every time whether sex is what you really want.", "How do they test for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)? When can I get tested for an STD?": "Health care providers test for STDs in several ways. Depending on the symptoms, they might do a physical examination of the genitals, test samples of fluids from the vagina, anus, throat and urethra, or do a urine test. They might also do a blood test for HIV, syphilis or hepatitis or they may do a mouth swab test for HIV. You should ask a clinic or doctor's office which STDs they test for. Some clinics routinely test for only a few infections, so if there is a particular test you need, ask for it. Also, don't assume that STD tests are part of a routine physical or pelvic exam. Some STD tests require written consent, so be sure you know if you're being tested and for what. Since many STDs have no symptoms, you can't rely on symptoms alone. The longer an STD goes untreated, the more damage it can do to you and others. STDs need to be treated because they won't go away on their own. For example, you may not have any symptoms that gonorrhea, but you can still pass the STD on to someone else if you're not treated. When you can get tested really depends on the STD. Some, like gonorrhea and chlamydia, can be detected in the body soon after you have been infected, even if you have no symptoms. STDs, such as HPV and herpes, can sometimes be detected in the blood before they show up on the skin, but those tests do not always pick up the infection before visible symptoms occur. Other STDs, like HIV, require a waiting period so that enough of the virus, bacteria or antibodies are present and detected on the test. Antibodies are created when you get a particular infection and your body tries to fight it. In the case of HIV, it can take up to three months for enough antibodies to be produced in the blood to cause a positive HIV test result. When you go to get tested, you will need to be prepared to share personal information with a health care provider. The provider will ask you about the types of sexual behaviors you did, the number of partners you had and when you last might have been at risk for getting an STD. Health care providers are not there to judge you, so it's important for you to be honest. In nearly all health care settings, this information is completely confidential, meaning the information won't be shared with anyone. When you make your appointment, ask about that health care center's policy on confidentiality just to be sure. Got a question about STDs?

On a girl or woman, the nipple is also where milk is expressed when she is breastfeeding an infant.", "The condom broke. What can I do, and what are the chances of pregnancy?": "It's difficult to say for sure what the chances are because the possibility of pregnancy differs for each situation. There are a couple of things to know, though. Ovulation must have happened in order for an egg to be fertilized by sperm. If the condom broke after your partner ejaculated, there's a greater chance of pregnancy than if it broke before ejaculation. If partners are having vaginal or anal sex and the condom breaks or slips off inside the vagina or anus before the guy ejaculates, they should stop having sex immediately. If they want to start having sex again right after this happens, they should put on a new condom before they continue. If a condom breaks or slips off, the female partner can still use emergency contraception (EC) within five days to avoid a pregnancy. Learn more about how EC works. To find a provider, go to The Emergency Contraception website or Backupyourbirthcontrol.org. People of any age can now buy Plan B One-Step without a prescription over the counter at a local pharmacy. However, Plan B One-Step emergency contraception is not effective at preventing pregnancy in people over 176 pounds. If you weigh over 176 pounds and need emergency contraception, you should speak to a health care provider about possibly using another emergency contraceptive pill or a copper IUD. If the condom slips off inside of someone and she or he can't get it out, she or he can go to a health care provider and have it removed. Don't worry, they're used to this and know how to get it out easily. If a couple is having vaginal or anal sex and the condom slips off or breaks, there is risk of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs ), including HIV. Both partners should get tested.

If your condom breaks, review the steps for how to use a condom to make sure it doesn't happen again.", "Does long-term cigarette smoking really cause impotence?": "There is definitely a link between impotence (when a guy can't get an erection ) and cigarette smoking. Many studies have found that grown men with \"erectile dysfunction,\" the medical term for impotence, are more likely to be smokers than non-smokers. This makes sense since nicotine constricts blood vessels and a guy gets an erection when blood is pumped into his penis. The average age in these studies was 51. That means it probably takes years of smoking for it to cause impotence, but it's still a real possibility.", "Yeast Infection": "An infection that is caused by an overgrowth of the naturally occurring yeast in a vagina. Symptoms can include itching, skin irritation, redness, white and clumpy discharge and burning during urination. The infection can be cured by using an anti-fungal medication which can be bought in a drug store. Wearing cotton, loose-fitting underwear and keeping the area around the vaginal opening dry can help prevent yeast infections.", "Ejaculate": "The fluid containing sperm that is released from the tip of the penis during ejaculation. This is also known as cum.", "Parental Notification": "A law that requires minors (young people under the age of 18) to tell one or both parents before or after getting an abortion.

It includes the labia majora, labia minora, the clitoris, the urethra and the vaginal opening.", "How can you avoid getting a sexually transmitted disease (STD)?": "The only 100-percent effective way to avoid getting an STD is to abstain from sexual touching below the waist, such as rubbing bodies without clothes, vaginal-penile sex, oral sex and anal sex. Your next best bet is to practice safer sex, such as using either a male or female condom and/or dental dam every time and getting tested regularly for STDs and asking your partners to do the same. STDs cannot spontaneously occur. There is risk only when one person already has an STD in their body. Since most STDs don't have symptoms, you can't always rely on what you see to tell you whether or not an infection is present since most STD infections do not have any symptoms, so it is better to be safe. While different STDs are spread in different ways, most are spread either through skin-to-skin genital contact or getting sexual fluids (and sometimes blood) in the mouth, urethra of the penis, anus or vagina. This means that touching above the waist with clothes on is safe. But most other kinds of close sexual contact with an infected partner carries some risk\u2014sometimes extremely low, sometimes very high\u2014of getting an STD. So, if you decide to be sexual with a partner, here are some things you can do to reduce your chances of getting an STD. Practice safer sex with each partner each time. Fenway Community Health has a great brochure that can teach you how to be a safer sex expert! Get tested regularly, and always get tested BEFORE you have sex with a new partner. Your partner should also be tested. Know your partner well before having sex. Ask your partner if he or she has ever had an STD and if it was treated. Ask when your partner last got tested and if they are willing to get tested again. Ask if he or she practiced safer sex with past partners and if that included oral sex. Know that people sometimes don't know they have an infection or may not consider certain behaviors risky, when in fact they are. Learn about STDs, how they are transmitted, and which activities are low risk and which are high risk so that you can make informed decisions about how to protect your sexual health. For example, kissing and massage are low risk. Unprotected vaginal or anal sex is high risk. Choose your sexual partners carefully. Take relationships slowly so you have the chance to get to know what your partner is about, what his or her sexual history is like and how your partner treats you in general. This will help you develop a relationship that is healthy and includes open, honest communication about these important issues. Even if you've both been tested and nothing has shown up, you should still practice safer sex every single time you have sex to guarantee that you both remain safe and protected. You should also use condoms if you have oral sex involving a penis. Flavored condoms are made specifically for oral sex and are available in most drugstores. During oral sex that involves a vulva or anus, use a dental dam, such as a Sheer Glyde Dam, to cover the vulva or anus. A condom cut open and placed over a vulva is also an effective barrier, and some people use plastic wrap\u2014the kind used for food storage\u2014for oral sex on a vulva, which is better than not using any protection. Still, a Sheer Glyde Dental Dam offers the best protection during oral sex on a female because it is less likely to break if stretched thin the way plastic wrap can. What is important to remember is that although latex, polyurethane, polyisoprene or nitrile condoms are highly effective products, sometimes people don't use them correctly. To make sure you know how to use a condom, review the steps here. Got a question about STDs?

Also called \"tits\" or \"titties.\"", "What is human papillomavirus (HPV)? Is it the same thing as genital warts?": "HPV (human papillomavirus) is a sexually transmitted disease ( STD ) that is caused by a virus. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), genital HPV is the most common sexually transmitted disease. About 20 million Americans are currently living with HPV, and there are an estimated six million new cases every year. There are about 100 different strains (kinds or types) of HPV and over 40 of those can infect someone's genital areas. HPV is usually passed by close skin-to-skin sexual contact (including oral, anal or vaginal sex ) between someone with the infection and their sexual partner. Different strains of HPV affect the body differently; some strains can be cleared from the body over time with no negative effects and no treatment. Others cause visible genital warts or an increased risk for cancer of the cervix, penis, anus, vulva, vagina and/or throat. The types of HPV that cause genital warts are not the same as the types that can cause cancer. In the U.S., there are two vaccines, Gardasil and Cervarix, which have been approved and offer protection against HPV for both guys and girls. Gardasil has been shown to protect females from the four types of HPV that cause most cases of cervical cancer and genital warts. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared Gardasil to be given to boys ages 9 to 26 as well as girls these ages. Cervarix is approved only for females and targets the two strains of HPV that are the leading causes of cervical cancer. There are many types of HPV. Some cause genital warts, but only a health care provider can diagnose HPV. A Pap test can be used to diagnose irregular cells on the cervix or in the rectum caused by HPV. Talk with your health care provider about whether you might benefit from a cervical or anal Pap. Once a health care provider makes a diagnosis for HPV, he or she will talk with you about the specific options that are available to you. Treatments are available to help people manage their HPV symptoms, but because it is a virus, it may remain in someone's body for life. HPV is spread through certain sexual behaviors. If you choose to be sexually active, the best way to minimize your risk is to use condoms and safer sex methods during all types of sexual touching. Keep in mind that condoms may not cover all areas of the genital skin where the virus is present. Also, the more sexual partners you have, and the more partners they've had, the greater your risk of getting infected. For more information, visit the American Sexual Health Association 's website.", "Premature Ejaculation": "When a boy or man ejaculates shortly after his penis becomes erect and with little or no sexual stimulation. This is a very common occurrence that happens less frequently as a boy or man gets older. Although many boys and men feel shame when this happens, there is nothing to be ashamed of; nearly every man will experience this at some point in his life. If it continues, he should speak with his doctor or clinician to see whether there is a medical reason behind the premature ejaculation.", "My breasts don't look like the other girls' that I've seen in the locker room. They're really small. Am I normal?": "Different girls develop at different rates, so there is no \"normal.\" Some of the girls in your class may be more developed than you, and so their breasts look like adult women's breasts, whereas yours have not fully developed yet. Different women and girl's breasts also look different. Not only do the size and shape of breasts differ, but so does the size, shape and color of the nipples and areola. A lot of girls worry that their breasts are too small and are therefore unattractive. A partner who truly loves and cares about you will be attracted to you for a number of reasons and will love your breasts simply because they are a part of the person they love. Not to mention, all people find different things attractive in a potential partner. Some girls and guys find certain qualities and characteristics attractive; other people find the opposite qualities attractive. There are definitely people who are attracted to smaller breasts.", "Virus": "A tiny organism that can cause infections. Some sexually transmitted diseases are caused by viruses. With these, the symptoms of the diseases can be treated but the viruses themselves can't be cured. These include hepatitis-B, herpes, HPV and HIV.", "Can you get pregnant from pre-cum?": "It's possible, but not likely, and it really depends on the situation and the person. Pre-cum or pre-ejaculatory fluid is released when a guy gets an erection. Pre-ejaculatory fluid cleans out the inside of the urethra, which is the tube that carries semen and urine out of the penis. The fluid makes the urethra less acidic and gives sperm a better chance of surviving the trip through the urethra and into his partner's vagina. One scenario where a guy's pre- cum could contain sperm is if there are live sperm inside a guy's urethra (because he has ejaculated recently). The pre-cum can \"pick up\" the leftover sperm on its way through the urethra and out of the penis. If a guy pees after he ejaculates, that would kill leftover sperm. So, say a guy has sex and cums at 9 p.m. He doesn't go to the bathroom after he has sex. At 10 p.m., he gets another erection and pre-cum fluid is released. That fluid can have live sperm in it. Is it enough sperm to get a girl pregnant? Possible, but not likely. A recent study found that some guys always have sperm in their pre-ejaculatory fluid, and some guys never do. It really just depends on how that particular guy's body works. It is impossible to tell (other than in a lab) who's pre-cum has sperm in it or whose doesn't. Again, it is enough sperm to get a girl pregnant? Possible, but not likely. No matter what though, pre-cum can carry sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), so a guy should put on a condom as soon as he gets an erection.

Some transgender people decide to use hormones, or younger trans people might use puberty blockers to prevent them from going through puberty for the sex they were assigned at birth, to have their bodies more closely match their gender identities. Others choose not to take hormones and instead use clothing to express the gender they feel inside. Still others decide that a combination of these options will help them achieve the body that most closely matches how they feel inside. Each person has to make the best choices for him or herself, so it's important to get good, accurate information. It is also very helpful to identify people in your life who can help you think things over. A trusted, supportive adult who cares about you\u2014like a parent or guardian, family member, close adult friend, clergy person, counselor or medical provider\u2014can be a great help in thinking things through. Hormones cause big changes in a person's body, so it's important to know all of the facts. Testosterone People who were born female may choose to take testosterone to make their physical appearances look more masculine. Testosterone will cause some sex characteristics typical of males. Changes can include the following: A deeper voice Redistribution of fat and muscle tissue Growth of hair on the body and face Changes in skin texture Growth of the clitoris Acne Baldness, even for younger people Interruption of period Increased sex drive Estrogen People who were born male may choose to take estrogen to make their physical appearances look more feminine. Estrogen will cause some sex characteristics typical of females to start. These can include the following: Redistribution of fat and muscle tissue Widening hips Changes in skin texture Development of some breast tissue Decreased ability to achieve an erection Decreased testicle size Decreased sperm production Decreased sex drive Estrogen will not raise your voice or shrink your Adam's apple. Because hormones are powerful drugs, they have to be prescribed by a physician. A family physician or endocrinologist may assist with preliminary exams and tests to make sure hormones will be safe for you to use. Again, having a trusted, supportive adult or adults help you figure out the medical system can be very important. There are some things that hormones will not change. Estrogen will not make a person's penis or facial hair disappear. Testosterone will not make someone's breasts disappear. Testosterone won't cause a person to grow testicles or produce sperm. Estrogen won't cause a person to grow a uterus or ovaries or produce eggs. If you have any questions or worries about what hormones may do to your body, be sure to ask. Some of these changes are permanent. This means that even if the person stops taking hormones, some of the changes that they caused may not ever go away. It's important to think hard about this while deciding about hormones. Also, some side effects may be mild, while others might be life threatening. Some people may think about buying hormones on the street, or sharing a friend's hormones, or using other drugs or substances not from a doctor to try to make their bodies change. This can be very dangerous. Using other substances or using more hormones than are prescribed can be deadly. Using a higher dose than your doctor prescribes will not make your body change any faster. Using too much can actually work against the changes you are waiting for and be bad for your health. It is also important to use clean needles when using injectable hormones, since HIV and other viruses can be passed along with shared needles. Bottom line: Only hormones and treatments prescribed by a doctor and filled by a pharmacist can help you achieve the body you desire while balancing the potential risks.

Some people think it means taking off your clothes and going through the motions of sexual intercourse, thrusting and grinding and rubbing against each other's bodies without ever having sex. Other people think it means going through the motions of sexual intercourse without taking off some or all of your clothes. Dry sex can give you sexual pleasure and orgasms, so it's definitely a type of sexual activity. But there's less risk than with sexual intercourse. It's a good idea to talk beforehand about how far you want to go and have safer sex supplies (like condoms and dental dams) nearby just in case. For a guy and girl couple, dry sex with clothes on can't result in a pregnancy. If ejaculation happens while wearing clothes, then there is no way for the sperm to get through the clothes and into the vagina. This form of dry sex also carries no or very low risk for sharing sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). If there are no clothes on, however, and semen comes in contact with the opening of the vagina, pregnancy is possible. This form of dry sex, no matter the sex of the partners, also carries a risk for many STDs. Some STDs such as herpes and HPV can be passed through skin-to-skin contact. This means that if a partner has a herpes sore on their upper thigh or in their groin region, and they rub this part of their body on their partner's genitals, herpes can be transmitted. This is why discussing sexual histories is important, as is getting tested for STDs regularly.

Emergency contraception (EC) comes in the form of pills (commonly known as the &#8220;morning-after pill,&#8221; even though it can be taken it up to five days after). The pills are sold under the name Plan B, Plan B One-Step, Next Choice and ella. EC can be up to 75 \u2013 89-percent effective if taken within 72-120 hours and for most brands is more effective the sooner it is taken. ella, however, is fully effective for all 5 days.

They offer misleading and medically inaccurate information about abortion. Common names of these centers include Crisis Pregnancy Center, Alternatives, Pregnancy Aid, Birth Right, Open Door or Pregnancy Counseling Center.

How much will it cost and will they tell my parents?": "There are a few choices for girls who need a pregnancy test. Home Pregnancy Test Home pregnancy tests are sold at drugstores and grocery stores and can be taken at home or at a friend's house. To ensure that the results are accurate, it is important to follow the instructions on the box exactly. It is most effective to wait until after a girl has missed her period to take a pregnancy test. If she is more than a day or two late for her period, she can take a home pregnancy test. Some newer home pregnancy tests, however, say they can give an accurate result the day a period is due or even a day or two before. Home pregnancy tests typically cost between $8 and $20 at a drugstore or grocery store. Some are available for even less than that online, but require a credit card number in order to purchase them. Health Center While home pregnancy tests are very accurate, girls might also want to consider going to a clinic for a pregnancy test, or at least for a second test. This can verify the home results and provide her with more options for care, including tests for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), birth control options and general answers to her questions about birth control and safer sex. A pregnancy test at a family planning clinic might cost anywhere between $5 and $20, and it may or may not include the cost of the appointment itself. Many clinics, however, offer low-cost or even free appointments. It's important to ask what costs are involved when calling to make an appointment. Lastly, a girl can go to her regular health care provider to have a pregnancy test. Most clinics, like a Planned Parenthood clinic, or other health center, will not notify your parent(s) or guardian(s) that you have had a pregnancy test. But it's always a good idea to confirm the clinic's confidentiality policy first when calling for an appointment. Talk to a Trusted Adult Many teens find that telling a parent, guardian or other trusted adult about a pregnancy can be helpful. Teens don't have to go to a clinic or health care provider alone if a parent or guardian knows and is willing to help. Parents/guardians can offer guidance and support during a really stressful time. So it's always good for teens to consider talking with a parent, guardian or an adult in their lives who they know well and trust, so they don't need to deal with this all by themselves.", "Ovary": "An organ in a girl or woman's body that produces, stores and, once a month, releases ova (eggs).

How can I help?": "According to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network ( RAINN ), one of the biggest things you can do for a friend or loved one who has been sexually assaulted or raped is to just listen and be there, without being judgmental or offering advice. It can take time for someone to deal with a sexual assault or rape, and there's no one correct way for anyone to react. Rape and sexual assault are acts that take power away from someone, so it's important that you not pressure your friend or loved one into doing something they're not yet ready to do. It's important that the person who experienced the sexual assault gets to have a say in how their healing process goes. You can encourage your friend to talk to a trusted adult about what happened. You can also let your friend know that there is help available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, through the . It's also important that you take care of yourself when you're trying to be there for a friend who has been sexually assaulted or raped. Hearing about sexual assault and rape, even if it didn't happen directly to you, can bring up lots of thoughts and emotions for anyone. For more information on reactions you might experience and how you can take care of yourself while helping a friend, check out this information about self-care from RAINN. This can help you continue to be a source of support for your friend or loved one.", "Clit": "A slang for clitoris.", "Fetus": "An organism that develops from an embryo after about eight weeks of pregnancy. A fetus receives nourishment through the placenta. It will eventually develop to full term and when it is born is called a baby.", "What is asexuality?": "Asexuality is a sexual orientation. People who are asexual do not experience sexual attraction and won't experience feelings of sexual arousal or attraction for other people, but they can still be interested in romantic relationships. For asexual people, attraction or wanting to form some sort of relationship\u2014romantic or otherwise\u2014has nothing to do with how attractive a person is, but is more about a desire to get to know a person. Some asexual people have romantic relationships and others don't. Some asexual people masturbate, engage in sexual behaviors with a partner and feel arousal, though it is not directed at another person. Some asexual people do not masturbate or engage in sexual behaviors with a partner. They may not experience arousal but do not see this as a problem that would need to be fixed.

It is also known as \"pee.\"", "Prostitution": "Providing sexual acts in exchange for payment. It is illegal in the U.S. except in certain parts of Nevada. It is legal in some parts of the world, for example, in Germany and Amsterdam.", "What are \"blue balls?\"": "When a guy is sexually excited but doesn't ejaculate ( cum ), he sometimes gets an achy feeling in his testicles and lower abdomen. The slang name for this is \" blue balls.\" This happens because the blood that has rushed to the genitals to cause the erection takes time to move back out of that region. The name comes from the myth that a guy's balls will turn blue and fall off if he doesn't ejaculate. It might be uncomfortable to have aching testes, but there are no long-term health risks. Eventually the erection goes away, or the guy ejaculates and relieves the pressure. Girls can get a similar feeling if they don't have an orgasm after sexual arousal. It may be a less severe feeling, but since guys' and girls' bodies both respond to sexual excitement, it makes sense that it would happen to girls, too.", "Bi-curious": "A term that refers to someone who is primarily attracted to people of a different sex, but who has romantic or sexual thoughts about people of the same sex.", "Pregnancy": "The process by which an implanted, fertilized egg develops into a fetus. This typically takes nine months.", "What is a \"hand job\"? What about \"fingering\"?": "A \" hand job \" is slang for stroking a penis with a hand. Fingering is when a person touches a partner's vulva with their hands. Many people think fingering is when someone puts a finger inside the vagina. Some people like this, and others may prefer it when someone rubs or strokes the clitoris, a small but sensitive organ just above the vaginal opening. Some people like both of these things. There is no \"right\" way to touch another person's genitals \u2014or your own\u2014because different things are pleasurable for different people. The specifics need to be explored by each person with honest communication. That means you may have to try different things and ask your partner what they like and what they don't. There's almost no risk of pregnancy from fingering or hand jobs. If a person has dirty hands and touches another person's genitals, they can spread germs or bacteria. It's also possible, but not likely, to spread a sexually transmitted disease ( STD ) this way. And, there's a very small chance of starting a pregnancy if semen gets on one partner's finger and that finger is put into the vagina immediately. It's a good idea to wash hands before and after any sexual contact.", "Rape": "The definition of rape can vary slightly from state to state, but generally speaking it refers to forcing someone to have some kind of sexual intercourse when that person did not want to or is legally unable to see whether they wanted to. For example, a person who is mentally or developmentally delayed may not in some states be able to consent to having sex; a person who is drunk or high is unable to legally consent to having sex. And a person under a certain age is unable to consent to having sex, called \"statutory rape.\" The age at which a person can legally consent to having sex also varies from state to state.", "Vasectomy": "A surgical contraceptive procedure in which a man&#8217;s vas deferens are cut and burned, closed or tied off. It is designed to be a permanent procedure but in some cases and with additional surgery it can be reversed. Vasectomy does not affect a man's sexual performance.

This is also called \"acquaintance rape.\"", "Blue Balls": "A term used to describe an uncomfortable feeling in the testicles when sexual excitement does not lead to ejaculation. In actuality, both males and females can experience this uncomfortable feeling as a result of sexual pressure that builds up but is not released. It is usually described as a full feeling or an uncomfortable ache that occurs in the genitals. For males, this occurs in the testicles (balls) and for females this occurs in the lower pelvic region. There is no damage as a result of pressure that is not released, and \"blue balls\" is never an excuse to keep going if someone wants to stop sexual behavior.", "French kissing": "An open-mouthed kiss in which one or both people use their tongues to play with the other's tongue and lips. Many people enjoy French kissing, and many do not.

These changes include a girl getting her period and developing breasts or a boy's voice getting deeper and growing facial hair.", "What is the prostate?": "The prostate is a gland inside a male body, about the size and shape of a chestnut. The gland is located immediately in front of the rectum if looking at the body from the front and its primary function is to make some of the fluid found in semen (most semen is made by the seminal vesicle ). Some guys find that stimulation of the prostate is very sexually exciting. It is possible to stimulate the male prostate by inserting a (gloved, lubricated) finger or a penis (with a condom ) into the rectum. The prostate will feel like a soft, spongy spot. If and how a person likes to have this area touched is up to them.", "What is a female condom and how does it work?": "A female condom \u2013also known as an internal or receptive condom \u2014is a pouch made of nitrile that is worn internally\u2014inside of the vagina during vaginal sex or inside of the anus during anal sex. When worn inside the vagina, a female condom can prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). It has a ring on each end, one open and one closed, and is connected by a condom-shaped tube. The closed ring is inserted into the vagina and fits around the cervix, which is the opening of the uterus. The other ring stays just outside the vaginal opening. This is where the penis is inserted during vaginal intercourse. To insert this condom anally, someone would remove the closed ring from the condom, place the condom over the erect penis and insert the penis inside the anus during anal sex. The other ring stays just outside the anal opening. Female condoms can only be used once. Never use a female condom and male condom together. They could rub together and rip, and you'll end up with no protection. When used perfectly, a female condom prevents pregnancy about 95 percent of the time. The typical use rate is a lot lower\u201479 percent\u2014because people don't always use them correctly. Just like condoms, female condoms only prevent the transmission of STDs that are passed through body fluids\u2014 HIV, gonorrhea, chlamydia and syphilis. Some STDs, like herpes and HPV, are spread through skin-to-skin contact. A female condom may not cover areas of the skin that are infected, such as the scrotum, labia or even the inside of the thigh. So condoms \u2013both male and female\u2014may not protect against these kinds of infections. The good news is that there are few side effects from female condoms. Some say they slip or are uncomfortable during sex, especially if the rings rub or pull against the penis or the vagina. Some, though, say the female condom stimulates the clitoris, which can increase pleasure during intercourse. Female condoms are sold in drugstores and supermarkets without a prescription. They cost about three dollars each.", "Do condoms work? What's the best brand and which type of condom is most effective?": "Absolutely, yes, they work! Latex and synthetic (polyisoprene or polyurethane) condoms have been tested and retested by manufacturers, researchers and are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to make sure people are getting great protection. When a condom is used correctly and consistently every time of you have oral, anal or vaginal sex, you are getting a lot of help at preventing pregnancy and/or the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Condoms\u2014when used correctly and consistently\u2014prevent pregnancy about 98 percent of the time. The typical effectiveness rate\u2014where mistakes are made or condoms break\u2014is about 82 percent. Condoms also protect against STDs that are spread through bodily fluids ( pre-cum, semen, vaginal fluids and blood). Those STDs include HIV, gonorrhea, chlamydia and syphilis. Some STDs, like herpes and genital warts, are spread through skin-to-skin contact. A condom may not cover areas of the skin that are infected, such as the scrotum, labia or even the inside of the thigh. So, condoms may not protect against the skin-to-skin transmission of these specific infections. Just check out these facts (and, for you skeptics, the research behind them): In a two-year study of couples in which one person was already infected with HIV and the other person wasn't, not one uninfected partner contracted HIV when the couple used condoms correctly each time they had sex. Have you ever heard that condoms are porous, meaning that they have pores or tiny holes? This is partially true. Natural skin, natural membrane or lambskin condoms do contain small pores that may permit the passage of viruses, including HIV, hepatitis B, and herpes. However, more than 80% of male condoms commercially made in the United States are made of latex or synthetic latex and do not contain pores. Latex works to completely block small viruses and bacteria that cause STDs. This means that even though viruses and bacteria are very small, they cannot pass through latex or synthetic condoms. Sperm can't pass through latex or synthetic latex condoms either. Using condoms lowers the risk of human papillomavirus ( HPV ) infection and women's and girls' risk of developing cervical cancer, a disease associated with HPV. It can be overwhelming to look at rows of condom boxes and not know if they all work equally well. The most important distinction to make between condoms is the material they're made out of. Condoms can be made of latex, polyurethane, polyisoprene or natural skin (or \"lambskin\"). Only latex, polyisoprene and polyurethane condoms prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Most studies have been conducted on latex condoms, but for people who are allergic to latex, polyurethane or polyisoprene condoms are also a good choice. Some condoms are sold as novelty items which means they're for fun, not protection; the packaging will say if they are meant for protection as well. Types of Condoms Latex condoms are the most common and affordable. They're durable and usually won't rip if they are used with a water-based lubricant, such as K-Y or Astroglide. Some major brands of latex condoms are Trojan, LifeStyles and Durex. Polyurethane or polyisoprene condoms can be harder to find. They're also very durable, and some people say these condoms provide even greater sensations than those made out of latex. Polyurethane and polyisoprene condoms are a great alternative for people with latex allergies and can be used with any kind of lubricant because this material does not break down as easily. The most popular brands of polyurethane condoms are Durex Avanti or Trojan Supra condoms. Natural skin condoms do not protect against STDs because they have tiny pores (holes) that can allow STDs to pass through. They do protect against pregnancy, and some people use them only for that purpose. There are also flavored condoms. These are designed to be used during oral sex. STDs can be spread through unprotected oral sex or skin-to-skin contact if semen or vaginal fluid gets into a partner's mouth or if a partner touches an infected area that is not covered by the condom. The flavored latex condoms help reduce the risk of getting an STD through oral sex. Flavored condoms shouldn't be used for vaginal or anal sex. The sugary substances that make them taste good can also cause infections. You can find flavored or polyurethane condoms in most drugstores or grocery stores. Female condoms are a soft, loose-fitting polyurethane or nitrile sheath and offer protection during vaginal and anal sex as well. This device has two flexible rings to hold it in place. The smaller ring goes inside the vagina and holds it in place. The wider ring remains outside the vagina during vaginal sex or the anus during anal sex. No matter what type or brand of condom you choose, it's important to learn how to use them.", "Abstinence-Only Education": "A form of sexuality education that teaches only about abstinence. No information is provided about condoms or other forms of birth control or safer sex practices. Unlike abstinence-only-until-marriage programs, there is not a timeframe or relationship status attached to when a person may choose to no longer be abstinent.", "Acne": "Bumps or sores caused by bacteria and oil that usually begin during puberty. Acne typically appears on a person's face, but can also appear on the neck, back and butt. There are many different skin care products that can be purchased at most grocery and drug stores to help treat acne, or a person can visit a dermatologist or skin doctor for prescription medicines.", "Anti-Discrimination Laws": "Laws that make it illegal to act in a prejudiced way against groups of people in school or at work. Anti-discrimination laws are written to protect people from discrimination based on their race, age, sex, religious affiliation, ability, nationality or body type.

These three trimesters make up the nine months of a typical pregnancy.", "What is a urinary tract infection (UTI)?": "When bacteria or other germs get into the urethra, a urinary tract infection (UTI) or bladder infection is possible. Symptoms include feeling like you have to pee almost constantly or feeling like you have to pee without being able to and/or feeling a burning sensation while peeing. A UTI is easily treated with an antibiotic prescribed by a doctor or other health care provider. If you see blood in your urine, though, the infection could be spreading and you should see a doctor right away. UTIs can be caused by bacteria left behind after sex. It's a good idea to pee right after you have sex, every time you have sex, to help wash away bacteria.", "What is Implanon? Does it really last three years?": "Implanon is a small, thin, implantable hormonal contraceptive, and yes, it is effective for up to three years. A trained health care professional inserts the small rod into a girl or woman's upper arm. The rod can be removed by a health care professional whenever the girl or woman is ready to become pregnant or when she wants to change her birth control method. If a girl wants Implanon, she can find a trained heath care professional who knows how to insert it through the Implanon website or by calling Planned Parenthood for a reference in her area at 1-800-230-PLAN (7526). How does it work? The small rod releases a synthetic hormone called progestin. This hormone keeps the ovaries from releasing eggs ( ovulation ). It also thickens the cervical mucus, preventing sperm from joining with an egg. Usually, the implant is not visible under the skin. However, in some girls, the outline of the implant may be visible. It may be possible to feel the hormonal implant in the arm. How well does it work? Implanon is highly effective, both in \"perfect use\" and \"typical use.\" Since girls don't have to remember to take a pill at the same time every day, there is very little room for error. In fact, Implanon is considered one of the most effective forms of birth control available. It has more than a 99-percent effectiveness rate. Like other hormonal birth control methods, Implanon does not provide any protection from sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Partners need to use condoms and get tested regularly for STDs. Are there side effects? Side effects are rare, but do exist. They include the following: irregular bleeding or spotting light or no periods acne change in appetite change in sex drive cysts on the ovaries depression discoloring or scarring of the skin over the implant dizziness hair loss headache nausea nervousness pain at the insertion site sore breasts If you experience any of these symptoms, talk to your health care provider , so that she or he can help minimize the side effects or take out Implanon if it isn't right for you. How much does it cost? Implanon could cost up to $300 to insert and another $100 to remove. Keep in mind that it is effective up to three years, so this could be cheaper than other forms of birth control in the long run. The costs vary by clinic\u2014it could be less expensive at one clinic and more expensive at another. Some health insurance plans cover Implanon. Girls need to ask their health care provider and their insurance companies about price when they are considering this birth control method.

At the same time, I think my teachers should say something, not just me\u2014the so-called token gay student. What can I do?": "You're right\u2014your teachers should take responsibility for making the school environment safe for all students. Many schools have harassment policies in place that teachers are required to enforce. Even though there are things you can do, it is worth noting that it can be exhausting to be the one \"token\" gay student who takes on the burden of educating students and teachers about gay issues. If you feel up to the challenge, here are some ways to bring about change so that you don't always have to be the only one \"doing something.\" 1. Find a teacher or administrator that you particularly trust, or who has reached out to you in the past. Talk to him or her about how you are feeling, specifically what it feels like when students say, \"That's so gay,\" and teachers don't say anything. If your teacher seems interested and asks how he or she can help, here are some suggestions: Ask the teacher to research the school's harassment policy and share it with the rest of the faculty. If the policy doesn't specifically include harassment based on perceived or actual orientation, ask the teacher to consider advocating for an updated policy. You could get other students involved in this, too. Help organize a training for teachers on LGBTQ issues at school. Ask the speakers who come to the training to talk about the expression, \"That's so gay.\" Find speakers here. Ask the teacher to talk to other teachers about the expression, \"That's so gay,\" and their required role in responding to the harassment. Help start a gay- straight alliance ( GSA ), so that an entire team of students can change the climate at your school to be more aware of homophobia. 2. Do some research. If your state school system has adopted the \"Safe Schools\" laws, then this expression is considered harassment and must be stopped by the school administrators. Check out Sexetc.org's Sex in the States to review the laws in your state. Be sure to follow the link in the sources for updates. 3. Go straight to the top and talk to your principal. You could try to talk to him or her about how problematic \"that's so gay\" is and ask that it be addressed in a staff meeting with teachers. If you want to do some research on this topic before you talk to your principle, then try these websites: Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network and Lambda Legal.", "Pussy": "A derogatory slang term for female genitals.", "What are the different types of adoption?": "There are two types of adoptions: confidential (or closed) and open. Both the birth and adoptive parents have to agree on what type of adoption they will have. In a confidential or closed adoption, the birth parents and adoptive parents never know each other. Adoptive parents are given some background and medical information about the birth parents, but they never meet or talk before or after the adoption is complete. In an open adoption, the birth parents and the adoptive parents know something about each other. They decide how much contact they'll have both before and after the adoption. In confidential adoptions, birth parents read about different adoptive families and choose the one they like best. Neither party knows the others' names. In adoptions that are more open, birth and adoptive parents talk over the phone and exchange first names. They might even decide to meet, usually at the adoption agency or an attorney's office. In some cases, birth and adoptive parents choose a completely open adoption. They know each other's names, addresses and phone numbers. They stay in contact by visiting, calling or writing each other. They may also allow contact between the child and the birth parents. Talk to your counselor about the type of adoption that is best for you. Do you want to help decide who adopts your child? Would you like to be able to share medical information with your child's family? These are all things to consider when deciding what type of adoption is the best choice for you.", "Smush": "A slang term for vaginal sex.", "RU-486": "This refers to another name for mifepristone, a medication used to end a pregnancy up to the seventh week.", "Semen": "The whitish, sticky fluid that is released from a penis during ejaculation.

If there is no sperm present, an egg will not be fertilized and will not attach to the wall of a girl or woman's uterus and it will leave her body along the lining during her period.", "Hymen": "A thin piece of tissue that partially covers the vaginal opening in most females. You can see pictures of hymens on the Young Women&#8217;s Health Web site.", "Can I get a sexually transmitted disease (STD), including HIV, from kissing?": "Herpes is the only STD that can be passed through kissing. This usually happens when one person has a sore on or around the mouth and then kisses another person. It can also happen during a select number of days throughout the year when the virus is more active in a person's body and when they may have no symptoms at all.", "Dysmenorrhea": "A painful period.", "Crush": "A slang term for having romantic feelings for another person.", "Virgin": "While there is no medical definition, it often means a person who has never had sexual intercourse. How sexual intercourse is defined is up to each individual.", "Balls": "A slang term for testicles.", "What is a condom?": "A condom is a thin piece of latex, polyiosprene or polyurethane that is worn over the penis during oral, anal or vaginal intercourse to prevent pre-ejaculatory ( pre-cum ) fluid or semen from entering a partner's mouth, anus or vagina. Condoms can be made of latex, polyisoprene, polyurethane and natural skin, but only latex, polyisoprene and polyurethane condoms prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Some condoms are called \"novelty\" condoms, meaning they're just for fun and probably don't protect against STDs. Be sure to read the package carefully so you know what kind of condom you're using and if it meets the needs that you have. Condoms come in different colors, flavors and textures. Some are lubricated to reduce friction and the chance of breakage. Others have the spermicide known as Nonoxynol-9, which does double duty. It kills sperm and lubricates. (Condoms lubricated with Nonoxynol-9 can be irritating. If you experience burning or itching, stop using them. Also, it is best to NOT use a condom lubricated with Nonoxynol-9 during anal intercourse ). Flavored condoms are supposed to be used only during oral sex. Don't use them for vaginal or anal sex because the flavoring might irritate the vagina or anus. Anybody, no matter their age, can buy condoms in most drug, grocery or convenience stores. Condoms usually cost about a dollar each, but many family planning clinics give condoms out for free or at a discounted price. You can also buy condoms through some websites. Make sure you know the steps to using a condom properly.", "Double Bagging": "Using two condoms, at the same time, instead of one. Using two condoms does not pose any risk for the condoms breaking, but it is also unnecessary because it doesn&#8217;t offer any extra protection.", "Circumcision": "The surgical removal of the foreskin from the head of the penis.

Hundreds of millions of sperm come out in each ejaculation, but it only takes one to cause a pregnancy.", "Cunnilingus": "A sexual behavior where oral sex is performed on a female, usually by licking or sucking a female's clitoris or vulva.", "How do I know what method is right for me?": "Deciding which method of birth control to use is a very personal decision. Birth control and sexually transmitted disease ( STD ) prevention is the responsibility of both partners, regardless of their sex. Most of the birth control methods are used in the girl's body, but this is only because it's much easier to control one egg a month than it is to control hundreds of millions of sperm every day. Another way to think about this responsibility is that guys are always fertile (able to contribute to creating a pregnancy ), but girls are only fertile when they have an egg that can be fertilized. Latex, polyisoprene or polyurethane condoms are the only methods of birth control that protect against pregnancy and STDs. We recommend people who are heterosexual use a condom and another form of birth control to get added protection against unplanned pregnancies and STDs. Here are some things to consider when deciding which method is right for you: Do you want a method that you take every day, regardless of how often you have sex, a method you only take now and then or a method that is only required when you actually have sex? Hormonal birth control provides the most effective prevention of pregnancy, but some people don't like the idea of taking hormones. Is a hormonal method right for you? Are you good at attending to details, such as taking a pill every day at the same time every day? Would you rather use a hormonal method like the Patch that you only have to think about once a week, or the Shot, Depo-Provera, that you would only have to get once every three months? Perhaps you only want to think about birth control when you are actually going to be having sex. Then maybe you want to use a diaphragm or sponge. Do you want your birth control to do double duty? Then male or female condoms, which prevent pregnancy and STDs, might be the choice for you.", "Pro-Choice": "Someone who supports a girl or woman&#8217;s right to decide whether to carry a pregnancy to term and become a parent, place a baby for adoption or have an abortion.", "Vas Deferens": "Thin tubes that transport sperm from the testes up past the prostate and seminal vesicles to the urethra.", "What is HIV and how do you get it?": "HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. HIV is a viral infection that can lead to AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome). When people first get infected with HIV, they often have no symptoms or very mild symptoms. The virus continues to weaken the immune system over a period of years. This can allow for specific infections and diseases to occur that a healthy immune system can typically fight off. At this point, the person is diagnosed with AIDS. With medication, an AIDS diagnosis may never happen or may take decades to happen. HIV can be managed with the right medications but there is no cure. HIV is transmitted through blood, semen, vaginal fluids or breast milk. If people already have a sexually transmitted disease ( STD ) and they're exposed to HIV, their chances of getting HIV are increased.", "Sexual Abuse": "Sexual touching or behaviors that are unwanted, including rape, touching another person's breasts or genitals and more.

Am I too young to have sex?": "A lot of teens wonder if there is a \"right\" age to have sex. Many adults would agree that 15 is too young to have sexual intercourse. But how old you are in years isn't the only way to know when and if it's the right time to have sex. Here are some things that people consider when they try to determine if they're ready to have sex: Have you and your partner talked a lot about why you want to have sex, what you expect from it, what worries or fears you might have about it and what you think it will be like? Have you talked about how it might change your relationship? What does having sex mean to each of you? Have you also talked to your parent(s) or guardian(s) or another trusted adult about your decision? Why do you want to have sex? Is it because you want to make your partner happy or make them love you? Do you want to feel older? Are you thinking of having sex because it seems like everyone else is having sex? If you're thinking about having sex for these reasons, you probably aren't ready. Sex doesn't prove love or make people more in love. It doesn't make you into an adult overnight either. And the truth is that everybody isn't doing it. Actually, most high school students aren't. The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance, a national survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2009 found that 66.8 percent of high school students are not engaging in sexual behaviors. That's more than half! Here are some things you need to be able to do before you're ready for sex. Talk to your partner about your relationship, sex, birth control and/or safer sex, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs ) and your feelings about each of those things. Visit a clinic near you to get the information and protection you need to be safe and responsible. If you're afraid to have any of these conversations with your partner or to visit a clinic or see your doctor about birth control and safer sex, then you're not ready. Wait until you're sure. You'll be happiest when you do what's right for you.", "Cunt": "A derogatory slang term for a female&#8217;s vagina.", "What does it mean to \"come out?\"": "\"Coming out\" is when lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender people who have been hiding their true identity tell friends and/or family members who they really are. The first few times a person does this are the toughest, but coming out is really a lifelong process. Each time gay, lesbian, bisexual or trans people meet someone new, they have to decide if, when and how to tell the person who they are. And that's scary, because many people react badly to people who don't fit their expectations. But coming out can also be liberating and exciting because you're finally being true to yourself. Part of what can be so empowering about coming out is that you get to decide how, when, where and to whom you come out. You are in control. Coming out can be very scary, but it can also carry with it a lot of joy.

A person's gender identity may or may not be related to their biological sex. This term is often used interchangeably with sex. However, sex is biological and refers to being female or male.", "What is bacterial vaginosis?": "Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal infection in girls. It has nothing to do with having sex ; people who've never had sex can still get BV. The symptoms are abnormal discharge, odor, pain or burning. The discharge might have a fishy odor and look white or gray in color. BV develops when there is an imbalance in the bacteria normally found in the vagina. Some of these bacteria are \"good\" bacteria, which keep the vagina clean and healthy, and some are \"bad\" and can cause infections such as BV. While not a lot is known about what causes BV, having more than one sex partner or being sexually active can, in and of itself, cause BV, but as we just mentioned, you don't have to be sexually active to come down with BV. BV can be diagnosed by a health care professional and is easily treated. If you notice any of the symptoms listed above, see your health care provider.", "How do I ask a partner to use a condom?": "Sometimes people don't want their partner to think they were \"planning\" on having sex since it seems more romantic for sex to \"just happen.\" But wanting to prevent an unplanned pregnancy and/or the transmission of STDs is smart. Being concerned about what others think keeps many teens from talking openly about sex and protection. Talking openly and honestly with a partner about condoms and planning ahead of time how to protect each other from sexually transmitted diseases (STDs ) and/or pregnancy is important. Ideally, you should talk about using protection, such as a condom, before you even start engaging in sexual behaviors. When you talk openly and honestly about your expectations, both you and your partner understand that if you do have sex, then you will be prepared to use protection. When you talk about using a condom, it doesn't necessarily mean that you have committed to having sex. It just means that protecting your sexual health is important to you. Even if you have decided to have sex but then realize that sex doesn't feel OK, you always have the right to say \"no,\" even at the last second. Partners need to respect the right of anyone at any time to change his or her mind. If you find that it is difficult for you to talk openly and honestly with your partner about using a condom, you might want to think about whether it's the right time for you to have sex. Using protection is part of having sex and is nothing to be ashamed of. Here's what other teens have to say about bringing up condoms with a partner: \"When my girlfriend and I talked about sex, there was never any question about condom usage. When we first started talking, neither of us was sure that sex was the right thing for our relationship, but we were sure of one thing: if we decided to, the condition for both of us is that we use a condom.\" \u2013Max, 17 \"I'd simply ask, 'You have protection right?' If they said no then I'd tell them, 'No deal. No condom no sex, but most importantly, no STDs.'\" \u2013Kristen, 17 \"When we're kissing, I ask my boyfriend, 'Hey, you have a condom, right? Just in case?' If he says no, then I let him know I'm going home early, so that we aren't even tempted to go without!\" \u2013Malik, 18 \"My girlfriend buys condoms in bulk from a website, and I pay her back for half.

They can happen without warning and at embarrassing times. They happen to most teen guys who are going through puberty. Spontaneous erections happen a lot less once a guy finishes puberty, although adult men still get them every once in a while.", "What is masturbation, and how do you do it?": "Masturbation is when people touch their own bodies for sexual pleasure. People masturbate in lots of different ways. Touching your own body for sexual pleasure is different for everyone. How you do it depends on what makes your body feel good. Some people may stroke or rub their penis or may use their fingers to touch themselves on or near the clitoris, the sensitive organ that is located just above the opening of the vagina. Masturbation sometimes results in orgasm ; sometimes it doesn't. Masturbation is a good way to learn about your body and your sexual feelings without the complications that can come when you have sex or do sexual things with someone else. Masturbation can't lead to pregnancy or cause a sexually transmitted disease ( STD ) either. People of all ages masturbate\u2014from infants to people who are much older. Some people choose not to masturbate. A lot of people believe that masturbation is a normal, healthy thing to do. You need to decide for yourself what you believe and whether or not you want to experiment with touching your own body. If so, just make sure you have some privacy. Masturbation Myths Debunked Myth: You'll run out of sperm if you masturbate too much and won't be able to have children. Truth: Sperm are constantly being made, so you won't run out, and there's no need to worry about not being able to have a child in the future. In fact, sperm only make up about 1 percent of what's in semen. Myth: Masturbation stunts your growth. Truth: No credible studies have shown that masturbation causes health problems, stunts your growth, causes hair to sprout on your hands, changes the way your genitals look or any of those other outrageous myths you might have heard. No one\u2014not even your health care provider \u2014will be able to tell if you've ever masturbated. Myth: Girls don't masturbate. Truth: It's absolutely true that many girls masturbate. In fact, most people do it at some point in their lives. Surveys show that 81 percent of males and 60 percent of females between the ages of 18 and 19 masturbated during the past year. That means it's normal if you do, and it's normal if you don&#8217;t.
